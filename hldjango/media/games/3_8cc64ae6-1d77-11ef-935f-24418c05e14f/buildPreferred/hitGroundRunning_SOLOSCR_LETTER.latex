\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{~~Day 1 Introduction}
\label{sec:Day1Introduction}
It's Friday November 13th, 1931 and the snow that blanketed New York City last night has briefly turned to light rain as the day warms. That hasn't put a damper on my first day as a Major Crimes Detective. I adjust my suit and slightly canted new fedora using my reflection in the train window. A loud announcer cackles to life as I ready for my stop, "Next stop on the Independent Line, 6th and 8th Street."

Captain Hunter selected me for Major Crimes and assigned me to Lieutenant Bruce Hoffbaur of the 6th Precinct in Greenwich Village (GV). I mainly worked Hell’s Kitchen (HK) while on patrol so there’s going to be some adjustment in terms of clientele but I’m looking forward to the challenge. I spent last night reading as much as I could about the neighborhood to prepare me for the change of scenery.

\hrulefill
\begin{displayquote}

Open the "Map Atlas". You will see that for each neighborhood map there is a one-page overview describing the neighborhood. Turn to the overview of Greenwich Village (GV).
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

The neighborhood overviews found in the map atlas are a good way to familiarize yourself with the different neighborhoods. Remember that just because you’ve been assigned to a certain Neighborhood doesn’t mean that Suspects, Witnesses and/or Victims may not be from or travel to different neighborhoods. If you are investigating a crime, you are expected to go wherever the leads take you.
\end{displayquote}

\hrulefill

The train rattles to a stop at the 6th Street and West 8th Street station. The station is rather busy for 630am as people of all walks of life go about their day. I know it’s not a far walk from here although the sidewalk is unlikely to be clear of slippery packed snow. I open my briefcase and confirm I have my Manhattan Directories as well as a full set of maps. I suspect they will be invaluable to keep handy.

\hrulefill
\begin{displayquote}

High \& Low is not a choose your own adventure. You’re not limited to a few options at the end of each section. I suggest you familiarize yourself with how each directory works by determining the correct Lead \# to get to the 6th Precinct using each.
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

\textbf{White Pages} - The White Pages are used when you have a person’s full name or a business name. They are organized numerically and then alphabetically by a person’s last name and then their first name OR by the business name. In this case look up "6" and there’s only one entry, the 6th Precinct. The address is listed and then the Lead \#.
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

\textbf{Yellow Pages} - The Yellow Pages are used when you are wanting to look up a business by the type of business they perform (e.g. Doctors, Hats, Tailors, etc). This is the business directory for Manhattan. The Yellow Pages are organized alphabetically by the type of business and then each business is listed under its appropriate category numerically and then alphabetically. After a list of the neighborhoods there is an Index of business types.
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

Look up "Police (NYPD) - Neighborhood Precincts" in the yellow pages (note that page numbers are yet present in the index), find the 6th Precinct under that category.  Note its address and the Lead \#.
\end{displayquote}
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

\textbf{Reverse Directory} - The Reverse Directory is used when you have a street address or a block number on a neighborhood map. Look at the map for Greenwich Village and you’ll see a Police Precinct symbol on Block 26 at the corner of 10th St and Greenwich Ave. You could have also gotten this location information from the White or Yellow pages.  So the police precinct is on block 026 of Greenwich Village. Now look up GV-026 in the Reverse Directory. From here you can see not just the police precinct itself, but also a list of some of the residents that are located \textbf{near} the police precinct, on the same block, or on neighboring blocks.
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

If a location has multiple people living at the same address, such as an apartment, split level home or townhouse then each resident will have their own Lead \# so you can speak to them individually (e.g. Apartments 2a and 4e will have the same address but will provide a different Lead \# so that you can speak to them independently); you may also be able to talk to the building landlord, super, or doorman, by locating them in the White Pages.
\end{displayquote}

\hrulefill
\begin{displayquote}

\textbf{No matter how you look it up, you should get 7-7336 as the Lead \# for the Greenwich Village Police 6th Precinct}.
\end{displayquote}

\hrulefill
\begin{displayquote}

This is the first Lead \# you are going to follow and you need to record it on your Case Log.
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
On the Case Log after the far left Day put a 1 on the line to indicate that it is Day 1 of your investigation. If you go to more than 15 of these Main leads in a single day put the same day \# on the line at the top of the next column to the right AND mark an Exhaustion Box at the bottom of the Case Log.

\end{itemize}
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
In the larger left column of your Case Log (below the Day) in the top half of the first box that says Lead \#, write "7-7336" over top of Lead \# (this is here as a guide). This is a Main Lead.

\end{itemize}
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
In the bottom half of the box where it says Name/Location: write "6th Precinct" over the top of Name/Location: (again, this is here as a guide).

\end{itemize}
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

The 3 smaller boxes are for any notes you would like to take, such as Secondary Leads linked to the Main Lead on the left (such as if you are asked to make a choice) or Evidence Letters (discussed later) that you have collected or need to open additional options. Secondary Leads DO NOT count for you 15 Main Leads you can visit before taking one Exhaustion.
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

This number is acting like a "phone number" but when you turn to this Lead \# in the Case Book it is as if you were following the lead and physically going there, not calling it.
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

If you have a Lead \# that you would like to follow in the future then write it in the next available Main Lead box and then write the person or business name or address in the bottom half of the same box. So if you are reading a lead and you see a person’s name that you’d like to visit later, write their name in the bottom half of a large lead box then continue reading or go ahead and look up the Lead \# and write it in the appropriate top half of the box.
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

The order that you visit Day Time leads does not matter as you can go to as many as you’d like. However, as the day wears on you will start to feel it.
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

The first 15 Main Leads are free each day and you will fill in one Exhaustion Box if you go to a 16th Main Lead in the same Day.
\end{displayquote}
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

If you go to your 31st Main Lead in one Day you would fill in the second Exhaustion Box (this would be very rare).
\end{displayquote}
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

Every Night Time Lead you visit you will fill in one Exhaustion Box.
\end{displayquote}
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

If all of your Exhaustion Boxes are filled in AND you would need to fill in another one, instead you must go rest and start on the next Day’s Introduction.
\end{displayquote}
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

You will be told in the daytime when you have a possible Night Time Lead for that night so plan accordingly.
\end{displayquote}
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

ALL the leads are not required and you can visit several more than is necessary to solve the case.
\end{displayquote}
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

You should save at least one Exhaustion Box to visit at least one Night Time Lead each night.
\end{displayquote}
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

In this Case, you should have at least ONE Exhaustion Box that is clear going into the Day 2 Night Time Lead.
\end{displayquote}
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

Tick the appropriate box when you follow a Lead \# so you know the leads you have visited. You can reread any previous lead you’ve visited with no penalty.
\end{displayquote}

\hrulefill

Now, turn to lead \textbf{7-7336} in this case book, the Greenwich Village Police Precinct, to start your first day (you’ll find its page number in the index).

\begin{displayquote}

During the End of Day Briefings if there is ever something that you haven’t done, Mark the Demerit Letter if there is one (same as marking an Evidence Letter but these are different - so Demerit (B) and Evidence Letter (B) are two different things). If you can’t answer a question asked by your superior Officer then STOP READING and IMMEDIATELY GO TO THAT LEAD\# and then RETURN to the End of Day Briefing when you have the answer or answers. Then continue from where you left off. If you have to go to a Main Lead that you hadn’t visited and it is the 16th or the 31st Main Lead for today then \textbf{DO NOT} fill in an Exhaustion Box.

The Precinct’s loud buzz of officers going about their business has been replaced by the blaring horns of Minnie the Moocher on the radio. The desk officer looks younger and more lively too as he taps his foot to the beat and does his best Cab Calloway impression.

I’ve had a long day and God knows how many coffees. On the way to my desk I see the Lieutenant packing his things up to head out for the night.

He looks up at my arrival, "How’d your first day in Major Crimes go? It seemed like you hit the ground running."

"I think it went well, Sir.", I adjust my suit, nervous I’ve missed something obvious that would have solved the case already.

"Why don’t you have a seat and you can run the case by me? I know it’s weird on account of you not having a partner and all but Captain Hunter spoke highly of you and I think you can rest easy. I spoke to some of the patrolmen you’ve run into today and they’ve all had good things to say about you. Especially David Barnes, I swear he went on for 10 minutes about you looking at footprints."

"I’m sure you took some photos of the footprints, right?"

\hrulefill
\begin{displayquote}

If you have (P) circled AND you have it labeled as belonging to the suspect then continue. If not, reread the 10 Downing St Lead.
\end{displayquote}

\hrulefill

"You spoke to the EMT’s that responded didn’t you? Frequently they can tell you some good preliminary information so you can form a good cause of death for the victim and sometimes they know some other useful information. They’re not as knowledgeable as the Coroner but they normally can give you some good insight."

\hrulefill
\begin{displayquote}

If you have (E) and have it labeled as the EMT Statement then continue. If not, circle the Demerit (E) and then go back to the 10 Downing St Lead \# and read the secondary lead to speak to the EMT’s.
\end{displayquote}

\hrulefill

"I hope you canvassed the area for any witnesses or people who may be able to help identify the victim or suspect. At the least you should have spoken to the Landlord in 5a."

\hrulefill
\begin{displayquote}

If you have Evidence Letter’s [V], [W], [X], [Y] and [Z] labeled as the Apartment Numbers and you have visited (circled) at least 3 of them and at least one of them is (5a) then continue. If not, reread the 10 Downing St Apartment 1c Lead and once you’ve visited at least 6 of the apartments in the building return here.
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

If you had not visited (5a), circle the Demerit (L) and then go back to the 10 Downing Street Apartment 5a lead.
\end{displayquote}

\hrulefill

I’m beaming with pride so far cause I’ve done everything he’s mentioned, "I did Sir, I know the importance of canvassing an area for further leads. Actually, I’ve got a couple of leads I want to follow up with tonight."

"That’s good, you’ve been at it a long time today and I want you to be fresh come morning. We’re about done here and if you’re not exhausted follow one or two of those leads and then get home and get some shut-eye. No offense but you look like you haven’t slept in three days. Before you head out, I want to ask you what you think are the most important questions that you need to answer about this case."

"Sir, I think the case hinges on a few things. How did the killer get into the house and who are they? As well as identifying my John Doe?" I look at him quizzically hoping I’ve covered everything.

"Exactly. Did you figure out who lives there and did they give you any useful information?"

"I was able to figure out who she was, unfortunately she has a form of dementia and wasn’t very helpful."

"Excellent work Detective. The way you’re chasing these leads and with a little luck you may be able to close this one soon. Knock out any Night Time Leads you’d like but I still want you here on time in the morning. Is that clear?"

"Yes, Sir."

"Very well, submit what you have to property to get it over to the labs so they can work on it tonight. Have a good night Detective. Great work today."

"And you sir."

The snow has completely melted off the roadways but still remains across the landscapes where people haven’t walked on the morning of Saturday  November 14th, 1931. I can’t help but feel I’m making a lot of headway in the case and I get in the office just before roll call.

As I get in the same veteran officer working the desk yesterday morning is also working now. "Major Crimes?" he says holding a small piece of paper out for me.

"Yes, thank you." I say as I take the message. It’s from a taxi driver with Rainbow Taxi.

"He called early last night."

The message reads "The Rainbow Taxi driver called and said he transported the girl you asked about to DeWitt Clinton Park in Hell’s Kitchen."

"Did you get his name or a call back number?" I ask, a little annoyed.

"Nope, he didn’t offer it. He probably doesn’t even have a phone. Didn’t say his name either, he sounded like you knew who he was. Sorry pal."

"Thanks, I guess it’s something." I say as I walk away and hear the radio start to get a little louder.

Today’s brief is pretty similar except I’m seated for the whole thing and there’s no murder at the end. After the brief the sergeant gives me some interdepartmental mail, a large yellow envelope with multiple spots to write the next recipient. There’s several that are crossed off and the most recent one says, "Major Crimes ‘Detective’- 6th Precinct." I can’t help but wonder if everyone is in on me earning my name.

I unwind the string and open the yellow envelope to find a letter that is written on the NYPD Fingerprint Lab letterhead. It’s brief and to the point:

~


{\ttfamily
\Large
\raggedright


The fingerprint analysis on two separate fingerprints you requested have been completed and we were able to locate a match for one of the submitted prints and we determined that the other one is not in the system. Please come to our office to pick up the results to add to your case jacket at your earliest convenience.


}


~

~

I’m excited I’ve got my first hit and imagine I’ll be getting both the fingerprint and autopsy lab reports today sooner rather than later.

I can’t help but feel an overwhelming excitement build up in me. I hope the identified print belongs to the murderer or the deceased individual. Either will help me get one step closer to identifying the killer or my homicide victim. I think these reports will help give me some more lines of inquiry for today’s investigation.

\hrulefill
\begin{displayquote}

If I know who committed the homicide, where they are going to be and have identified the John Doe then I should follow any more leads I’d like to and then end Day 2 with at least one clear Exhaustion Box to go after my suspect during the Night Time Leads.
\end{displayquote}

\hrulefill

There are no demerits at tonight’s end of day briefing. There is a list of questions that I should be able to answer before I move on to the Day 2 Night Time Lead. If you are able to answer the mandatory questions then move to the Night Time Lead for the Conclusion (which includes a moral choice on how you wish to handle the closing of the case).

I think I’ve built my case and I have a decent idea of what occurred yesterday morning. I sit down with Lieutenant Hoffbaur and tell him what I have so far and what I think happened. He asks me the following questions.

Mandatory- Don’t move on unless you have these answers.
\begin{itemize}
\item 
"What is the name of the victim of homicide?"

\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
"Who was staying in the spare bedroom in 1c?"

\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
"Did you find the ciphered message, if not you need to try to track down the suspect? If the suspect is not in a directory there must be another way to locate them.

\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
"What is the "Key Phrase" for the ciphered message you found?"

\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
"What is the name of the suspect’s significant other and where are they meeting?"

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Bonus Questions}- These are good to at least have a vague idea but are not required. They may help you to know where to go next.
\begin{itemize}
\item 
"What other crimes were committed or attempted in 1c Friday morning?"

\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
"What is the homicide victim’s nickname?"

\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
"How did the homicide victim get through the double doors to 10 Downing St (may not be by committing a crime)?"

"Ma’am, ma’am." I say trying to rouse her from her sleep. I place my hand on her shoulder and try again.

She stirs and her wrinkled face turns towards me and her eyes seem to be distant as she speaks. "Michael, it’s you. You’ve made it back from Germany after all of these years."

"Ma’am, I’m not Michael. I’m a detective with New York City Police."

"You’re not Michael?" She looks almost startled as the sleep clears from her head. She looks at me again and realizes I’m not Michael. "Have you seen him? Where am I?" She looks around the room slowly at first and then more frantically. It’s as if she’s seeing it for the first time. Fear crosses her face as she realizes with the medals and pictures all around her of her Michael what must have happened to him. She almost starts to cry and my heart softens for her as I realize she must have some sort of Alzheimer’s Disease and her memory is fading. I know they’ve only really started to figure it out but I know there’s no cure for it and I’m not likely to get a lot out of her. The longer I talk to her the more I realize that she’s not really coherent right now.

I sit and talk with her for a while. I ask if her name is Mira Murphy, like on the pill bottles, and she confirms she is. She also tells me she was never married to Michael but she took his last name anyway. She can’t give me any information on anyone living there besides her but she does say that someone gives her medication every night or day but she can’t quite put her finger on their name. I thank her for all of her help and tell her I’ll be in the other room if she needs anything.

\label{sec:1{-}3018}
I walk up to 10 Downing Street and I see a painted gray brick five story apartment building with a white-trimmed and propped open double door at the entrance and the whole thing covered in wet snow. A metal arch goes over the sidewalk about five feet in front the doors and connects a fence that goes the length of the front of the building either way. I recognize the nod or maybe just downright plagiarism to 10 Downing Street in London. It appears New York has decided to copy London’s weather as well and clouds cover the sky as the day starts to warm.

A gray brick sign out the front says 10 Downing St Apartments in big white letters and the office phone number is below it in smaller black letters, 1-3018. I can tell the residents in this building are well off by the extravagant if not pretentious extras on the building. Yellow crime scene tape spider webs between the sign and the metal fence. A short white freckled-faced female officer wearing a heavy winter jacket and gloves is standing inside the tape by the double doors that serves as the entryway to the apartment building. She looks in my direction but appears to be looking past me. I hear heavy breathing and turn around to see Patrolman David Barnes unzipping his heavy winter jacket coming from either Bleeker or Minetta Street. He takes several deep breaths and is visibly tired from his morning exertion. "Good morning, Sir. Are you the detective from Major Crimes that caught this unlucky case?"

"Yes, I am." I smile at him, "Why do you say unlucky?" I question as he starts to catch his breath which I can see puffing out in the cool air like a steam engine.

"Welp, we haven’t ID’ed the dead guy and the suspect got away. The perp burst through those doors like a rabbit being chased by a greyhound. I chased ‘em all the way to Washington Square Park but that’s where I lost ‘em." A look of disappointment spreads across his face. "The worst part is I couldn’t even see their face on account of it being so dark. I know they were wearing a robe or a trench coat or something that was flappin’ in the wind behind ‘em." He points at the ground and I see some barefoot prints in the snow. "That’s their prints right there." I take out my newly issued Nagel Pupille camera and take a photo of the ones he says belong to the suspect. The suspect wasn’t wearing shoes so it’s obvious the booted prints are his but I don’t see the point in bringing him down, especially after how disappointed he appeared to be for not catching the suspect.

I measure the length of the foot and write down that the foot is exactly 10 ¾" and note the spacing between the prints made by the left and right feet mean the suspect, despite the snowy conditions, was probably running at a full sprint. Looking back at Barnes I’m imagining someone quite athletic to be able to escape his efforts. I think of it in my head and I realize that the suspect probably had a decent head start since Barnes was coming from the subway and the suspect ran the opposite way before losing him in Washington Square Park.

\hrulefill
\begin{displayquote}

\end{displayquote}

\hrulefill

I consult my evidence book and realize that my suspect is between 5’6" and 5’10", Barnes starts walking towards the female officer. "Why don’t we go talk with Stacy? She’s the one that heard the commotion in the first place. I bet she can tell you even more."

"I think that’s a good idea and you’ve been a lot of help Barnes. Thanks." As I thank Barnes his face lights up with pride.

Barnes and I walk over and Patrolman Stacy Cavalier greets me and I pinch the front of my fedora in greeting, "Your partner filled me in a little but could you give me your side from the beginning with what you’ve observed today please ma’am?"

"Sure thing, Sir. Barnes and I were walking our Beat and we had just checked the subway at Downing and Varick St to make sure the homeless were behaving. They were harmless enough and seemed to be trying to stay warm and dry. We were just trying to pass the time really because our shift was supposed to end at 0700 hours. We walked out right at 0610 and we began to walk around the block before our shift ended. We were on Downing Street just past Bedford Street when we thought we could hear a commotion coming from the side window of the apartment building. I could just make out sounds of some movements, like someone getting ready for work or something, and we didn’t think anything of it. We were startled by a muffled scream of pain or shock coming from a man inside the building."

"We started running over towards the apartment building and someone ran out of the double doors leaving them wide open behind them and fled Northeast towards Minetta St over there and David took off after them." She points in the direction I saw Barnes walk up from. "I really just saw a silhouette, I mean, there were streetlights but they weren’t that bright. David yelled ‘Stop! Police!’ and was on his whistle while chasing who I can only guess was the murderer. The sudden flight from the apartment building seemed odd so I ran into the building to make sure everyone was ok. At first I thought it was an interrupted burglary but I didn’t hear an occupant yelling in complaint from inside."

"It seems like there’s three apartments on each floor and as I stepped into the hallway I couldn’t hear anything but I noticed at the end of the hall on the right the door to 1c was open. I walked over and announced that I was the police. I heard irregular breathing and coughing from a room in the back of the apartment."

"The open door led me to the front room with an attached kitchen at the back of the front room. I made my way through the kitchen to find a short hallway. The light from the building hallway didn’t reach so I called out that I was the police several times as I got my flashlight out."

"An open door to an empty bathroom on the left, a closed door straight ahead and a room on the right with another open door. It was from in there that I heard the strained wet breathing just before the breathing stopped."

"I shined my light on him and saw him lying on the bed covered in blood. A bloody kitchen knife was in his right hand and blood soaked his shirt and spilled from his mouth. I ran over to see if there was anything I could do but he had expired. The blood on his chest had small bubbles which I’d never seen before. He looked real pale and the rest of his body was covered in sweat. He reeked of poor hygiene and his body odor didn’t fit the apartment at all."

"It must have been him that I heard yell which means he must have died quickly."

"I turned on the lamp on the bedside table and had a quick look around. I hadn’t heard from David so I wanted to put the call in to get more officers to help. I had to go back to the car parked down by the subway to radio it in. Some other officers responded to my call and went to help David chasing the culprit but I didn’t know where he was. I could hear his whistle off in the distance and I said they were headed towards Washington Square Park. I got this crime scene tape up around the entrance when I remembered the closed door at the back of the hallway. I went back in and found an elderly woman sleeping there. I didn’t want to disturb her till I had more people here. The EMT’s got here about 10 minutes before you did. The two of them checked him out and were in and out rather quickly. I asked that they not disturb the crime scene too much."

"That was smart of you." I nod my head approvingly. "Please continue."

She points towards two men in long sleeve navy shirts and slacks with white New York City EMT hats and black gloves. "They’re over there if you want to speak to them or the victim is in 1c."

"Sir, I almost forgot. I think the landlord is in apartment 5a. You may want to speak to them as I’m sure they have some solid information on all the different residents." She points at the mailboxes and the names are listed, the same as the reverse directory but for 5a it says, "Property Manager".

NY Times                               Sunday August 28, 1932

By Janine Steele

The NY Police reported that Friday’s stabbing victim at 10 Downing Street in Greenwich Village was the result of a botched break in. The police have been unable to locate the main suspect in this case.

The police released this statement, "The deceased had attempted to burglarize a tenant of the apartment when a resident inside stabbed him with a knife and fled. It is believed the resident may have defended themself but without speaking to them we can only speculate. A warrant was written for Juanita Murphy to bring her in for questioning."

The police believe that there is no further threat to the community and ask that if you know anything about this case you contact them.

The smell of this place is amazing. I’d have thought I was in Italy with all of the traditional smells of Italian herbs and spices. I speak to a couple of employees and confirm rather quickly that Lucchese was at work the night before the murder and that he drank with most of his employees at their bar before getting a train on the subway around 2am.

I knock on 1a and hear the playful response, "Whoever could it be?". Blonde Bombshell opens the door, this time wearing a barely there red negligee that somehow rides higher than the black one earlier.

She playfully pulls me by the tie into the apartment. I take in the cleaned and cared for apartment’s rich decor quickly. She kisses me and leads me through the apartment. I look on the kitchen counter and see a silver plated Waldorf Astoria Hotel side handled coffee pot. I assume it’s empty since it is sitting on the counter and not the stove. I can’t help but laugh to myself, did I really think she was making me coffee?

We get to Bombshell’s room and she places my fedora on her own head and begins helping me take the rest of my suit off. She sits on an overstuffed comforter that covers her white silk sheets and gestures for me to join her. I do and we spend way too much of the night enjoying each other’s company before I collapse from exhaustion.

\hrulefill

I wake up to the smell of bacon and eggs and an overwhelming fear that I’ve overslept on my second day as a Major Crimes detective. "Don’t worry," Bombshell says while holding a plate of bacon and eggs. "I got you up in plenty of time for you to get to work on time." She pushes a velvet curtain to the side revealing the darkness outside and my disheveled reflection in the glass. I relax instantly and smile at her as she hands me the plate. I feel like I’d like to take that vacation more and more as I think of last night’s activities.

I watch her walk out of the room as I begin to eat. The scent of the fresh coffee hits me before Bombshell walks back in with the cup. "You didn’t think I would have forgot your coffee, did you?" I can’t help but smile as I finish eating. This is amazing coffee.

I get in the shower and Bombshell joins me. That wakes me up more than the coffee. I can’t help but feel like I’m going to feel it tonight, but right now I’m invigorated and want to get to the office to hit the ground running on today’s investigation.

I approach the first cab, a black cab with "Rainbow Taxi Services" and "Call now: 5-2757" and introduce myself. The cabbie seems interested in my story but I also realize he sits in a cab all day and waits for fares so his expectations are probably pretty low for what’s interesting. I seem to have piqued his interest though because he steps out and talks to a couple of the other drivers for me.

"I can’t remember for the life of me but one of the new Rainbow Taxi guys was running his mouth earlier how he picked up this broad wearing only a nightgown and a robe. He said she was a pretty little colored lass. He said she didn’t have any money and as distraught as she seemed he couldn’t just turn her away so he turned the meter off and gave her a ride anyway. He didn’t say where he took her to, only that it was somewhere Northwest. He said she was probably 5’6" maybe 5’7" and the smoothest ebony skin you’ve ever seen."

"Did she have any blood on her?"

"Not that he told me. He said she was so cold she was shaking and she kept her hands tucked under her armpits the whole time trying to stay warm. He didn’t mention any blood though and I think he would have. He’s a bit of a pervert. He said he wished she’d have moved her arms so he could have seen what she had going on up top. If you know what I mean?"

"I do, thanks. Do you know his name or where I can track him down?"

"I can’t say I do. He’s a new guy and they don’t keep the best of records at Rainbow. Most of us drivers are borderline homeless or living with a family member so I doubt knowing his name would help you. I guarantee if he turned the meter off he wouldn’t have told dispatch so they won’t be able to help either. Do you have a card and I’ll call you if I see him?"

I pop my briefcase open and grab a card for him. "I sure would appreciate it if you could."

He smiles, a stark contrast to the bored look on his face when I approached him. "Will do, Sir. Will do."

I’ve got other leads I need to follow and I turn from the excitement I’ve brought to his life. I get almost the length of the park away from him when I realize I didn’t get his name. It’s ok, he has my card and I have all the information I need.

"Ma’am, I understand why you may fear how this case would be handled in court. You need to understand that if I don’t take you in right now, I’m going to have to write a warrant for you as a person of interest. That means if you ever return to this area or are stopped by a police officer you will be arrested and brought in. Are you sure that’s what you want?"

She stops sobbing and turns towards Wayne. "What do you think I should do?"

He looks at her and hugs her tightly. "I don’t know, I’ll be here for you right by your side the whole time. It does mean we couldn’t get married but we can still be together forever and that’s all I care about."

"If I let you go on the run, I would have to sign a warrant for you. It’s true, you may never get caught if you keep your head down but that’s your choice to make. If you want to run I’ll say I never found you and by the time I solved your code you had already fled. I’ll tell you this though, we aren’t going to pursue you like we would if we thought this was malicious, but if you get stopped..." I trail off and let her connect the dots.

"The only reason that made me want to run was because I was afraid I’d never get to see my fiance again and to be honest, I just can’t risk it in court." She looks at him with worry on her face.

"Honey, I’ll be by your side through it all." She smiles at that and hugs him.

"Well, I never saw you tonight. Good luck to the two of you."

Their train is pulling into the station and they’ll be on it soon. I head back to the office feeling like I’ve done the right thing. If nothing else I gave her a choice and that’s more than what Henry Phillips ever did.

As soon as you open the door to the bank you can tell a lot of money went into this building. All the hardwood surfaces are varnished and shined and you notice all of the employees appear to be neatly dressed in suits and the ornate tiles on the floor look like they get waxed every night. After a couple of enquiries I’m directed to George Padovano, the Lending Manager for Atlantic National Trust. His secretary gets me a coffee in a pretentious white cup decorated in flowers placed neatly on a saucer with two pieces of a rather expensive looking chocolate and I sit down to talk with him.

"Has your bank ever provided a loan for a Juanita Murphy?" I say as I sink into the plush leather chair in his office. I take a drink of my coffee from the cup I was given and replace it on the saucer before putting the whole ensemble on the little table beside my chair.

He sorts through some files, and a look of recollection crosses his face as he takes a manilla folder out, "I found it. We had to foreclose on her. She was just too far over her head with that one. I’m not sure if you know this but Finula Murphy took pity on that colored girl Juanita and adopted her. When Finula passed she left the house and the remaining mortgage to her." He pretends to flip through the pages but it’s clear to me that he remembers exactly what happened. As he says it, even he doesn’t seem convinced there’s no underlying reason for the sudden foreclosure and that he’s not living like it’s 70 years ago.

"How far behind was she?" I ask, knowing it was less than a month and his answer is probably going to make me angry.

"About a month and that was generous. Her mom, if you can call her that, is the one that got the loan with us. Not her. Due to a fault in the Finula Murphy’s last will and testament we had to put Juanita’s name on the loan because at the time she was working." He shifts uncomfortably and I realize I’m shooting daggers at him with my eyes. I try my hardest to smile instead but my blood is boiling. I see in the giant mirror behind the lender that my face is starting to flush red in anger.

I take a deep breath that doesn’t seem to help. "Is that common to foreclose when someone is behind less than a month on their mortgage?" I question through my pursed lips with a tone that says I know the real reason she was kicked out knowing that it wasn’t common at all.

"We can’t be giving these colored people run of the city Mr…" he trails off not knowing my name and realizing I’m not on his side, "You know what, I never got your name detective and to be honest I don’t like the cut of your jib. I think you’ll need a warrant if you're going to question the way I do business." He stands up and steps back, using his oversized desk between us to make himself feel safer. "Go on and get outta here. Don’t come back unless you got a warrant." His voice is shaky and he cowers behind his oversized desk but I can tell he doesn’t like that he and I don’t see eye to eye. I let him sweat back there as I finish my coffee and take both chocolates. I put them in my mouth before I say something further that he’ll surely regret but would probably make me feel better.

"I’ll see myself out. Oh, sorry about that." I put the half empty cup down on the saucer and drop it noisily to the floor on ‘accident’. He opens his mouth as if to say something but chooses wisely to be quiet. I exit the office and the bank.

I approach the two EMTs and the taller of the two steps forward. "Good morning sir. I’m the one who checked the stabbing victim. I’m guessing he lives here in 1c because when I got in the apartment he was in the bed on his back. The killer must have woke him up with the knife. It looks like he had already pulled the knife out as the blood seemed to have come out onto the bed and he had the knife in his right hand. He shouldn’t have pulled the knife out, that might have been like the boy and the dike situation." He motions like he is sticking his finger in a dike to stop the flow of water and I indicate with my hand for him to continue.

"Right, I’m not sure we could have done anything for him anyway because the wound had gone between his top left ribs and seems to have gone into his lung cause it appeared he coughed up blood and the officer said the blood from his chest was bubbly like a red champagne." He holds his right fist with an imaginary knife in it over his own plain jacket above his left breast. "We didn’t see that but he’d been dead close to an hour by the time we got here it sounds like."

"Of importance to you is that the murderer is probably right handed. I think that’s why it went into his left side. To get a knife between the ribs like that you’d probably be using your strong hand or maybe even driving it in two handed. I doubt it’d be that hard surprising a man like that. The way he smelled and the way his clothes were he was probably about to have a bath. I don’t want to give you bad info, that’s just how I see it.

I would check with the coroner later today or tomorrow to see what he says. They always rush the autopsy when you bigwigs in Major Crimes get involved."

"Oh yeah, When we checked his back for further injuries a pill bottle came out of his pocket and my partner there picked it up and put it on the bedside table." He points at the other EMT. "Best of luck solving this one. We’re going to get in the wagon and get warm. Once you release the body to the coroner we get to take it so we’ll be over here staying warm."

I come to knock on 3c and notice that there is no 3b, instead a storage area and a laundry room with two expensive looking GE 2-Tub Washers are here for the residents along with two large drying racks. I knock on the door several times but there is no answer.

"Sir, I collected this today. Have you had time to look at it?"

"I had a quick look at it and it’s a unique one. This is classified as an arch. That means that the ridges flow from one side to the other and there are no deltas, which are the small triangular intersections. Arch fingerprints with no deltas like this one are the rarest classification of fingerprints and make up about 5\% of all fingerprints."

"Assuming the print is in the system, I’ll have it to you first thing in the morning and will let you know through interdepartmental mail when it’s complete."

\begin{displayquote}

In the full game he would narrow your search down to the first 5 fingerprint cards of the 100 total as those 5 are this classification. You could then identify it yourself now. You would compare the fingerprint card that matches and check a chart in the back of the case book to get the name of the match, then you would mark (D) OR you could wait until the next day after you found it (it’s assumed you turn them in at the end of the shift whether you came here or not) and return here. In this case you will have to wait till tomorrow and return here as there are no fingerprint cards currently available.

\label{sec:3{-}2790}\textbf{Apartment 4a (\#\hyperref[sec:4{-}2174]{4{-}2174} on p.\pageref*{sec:4{-}2174}) contd.}%


I knock on the door to 4a. It’s quite inside. After a brief moment a 20 something 5’6" Hispanic woman answers the door. I identify myself and she tells me her name is Delia Ayala. I ask her about yesterday morning and she tells me in a Spanish accent that she can’t help me. When I mention the apartment number a shot of fear crosses her face. I explain that the elderly woman in 1c is fine but she still looks worried and I realize she must know something about the case. I just have to get it out of her, "Do you know the elderly woman in 1c?"

"Yes, somewhat. Are you talking about Miss Murphy?"

"Yes."

"I know her a little. She’s pretty much bedridden. I’m good friends with her home healthcare aid. I guess not good friends but I’ve had tea with her a couple of times and I like her. She’s a lovely colored lady named Leisha Mooney. Oh my God, she’s ok isn’t she?" The fear sweeps over her again and she covers her mouth dreading my reply.

"I don’t really know her involvement yet but she wasn’t the one we found deceased." Do you know of any white men that see Miss Murphy regularly or stay with her?"

"No, not that I can think of. Miss Murphy never had kids but she’s the kindest soul and would do anything for you, for anyone really. I know she let Leisha stay in her spare bedroom a couple of times, like when she was having some issues with a burst pipe at her house. I don’t know of any men that ever stayed there though. Was the killer a man or a woman?"

"I don’t know, whoever it was they ran like the wind and the Officer didn’t catch them."

Relief spreads across her face. "That’s probably not Leisha then, she has, how do you say politely, a fuller body on her so, I doubt she could have eluded capture."

With that bit of information I went from thinking I had my killer to knowing I probably wasn’t any closer. It sounds like Leisha is probably too big to be outrunning Barnes but maybe she would know something about this unidentified John Doe or the killer. I say my goodbyes and follow another lead.

\label{sec:3{-}3254}\textbf{Apartment 5a}%


As I’m walking up to 5a’s door I see the door is already open. An olive skinned man with dark brown eyes of Italian descent is seated on the couch listening to Guy Lombardo singing Goodnight Sweetheart when he looks over to see me and stands up to come out and greet me.

"I thought I’d be seeing you. I’m the landlord and caretaker of this apartment building. I like to believe I know a little about every apartment I manage. Some of the tenants rent and most own but they still have me here to look after the place. I will help any way I can."

I believe him when he tells me he is knowledgeable about the apartment. I'm just concerned that with him being all the way up here he may not know about the goings on as much as I’d like. I explain that there is a dead man in the bed in apartment 1c and he looks at me confused. "Do you know who that could be?’ I ask.

"No, I really have no idea. Miss Murphy doesn’t have any men in her life that I know of. Her childhood sweetheart passed away in the War and was a heavily decorated serviceman. I want to say he was Army but he may have been a Marine, not too sure. She must have been in love because even though the two never married, she took his last name and he left her the place when when he was killed in action. She’s lived alone for the longest time but on occasion she has let her nurse stay in the spare bedroom."

"Her nurse is a nice colored woman, a real forbidden fruit, and if I can be Frank with you I’ve tried to court her a few times. No luck, but I’ll keep trying. She comes by every evening dressed in the nicest dresses and low heels. Normally between seven and ten most nights I think. I try to make excuses to be down that way when she arrives or leaves but I’m never really sure what time for either." His eyes light up as he talks about her.

"Last night I did catch her leaving about 915pm when I ducked out for some milk and bread before the snow, so I don’t think she’s staying there right now. To be honest, I don’t even know her name, which is kind of pathetic if you ask me but I just get so tongue-twisted when I talk to her." He looks down seemingly embarrassed.

"Would you mind if I asked you some questions about some of the other tenants?" I change the subject hoping to help him relax.

I enter the Atlantic National Bank foyer again and look back to George’s office to see him sitting at his desk with another person. He looks up, notices me and concern spreads across his face as his shaky hand picks up the phone on his desk.

A security guard walks up to me shortly after, "I’m sorry Sir, Mr Padovano would like to know if you have further business here, like a warrant. If not, he would like me to show you the exit." He extends his hand to the door.

"I don’t have a warrant." I say as I look at George. He smiles in victory as if he read my lips. I smile back and his smile quickly turns to deep concern. I don’t have anything for him but that look of fear was worth coming back for.

"Please Sir, I’ll have you leave at once then." He puts his hand on my elbow to escort me out.

I shrug his hand off of me, "Don’t you fucking touch me. I know where the door is." I walk out before there’s any more trouble.

This two story brick split house has the name Saenz on one mailbox and Mixter on the other. The one with Saenz appears to be who I’m looking for. I knock on the first floor and it’s not long before a 5’ tall woman clearly of Hispanic descent comes to the door with a baby wrapped in a blanket, "Senior?"

"I’m sorry ma’am, do you speak English?"

She holds her free hand out, fingers extended and wags them side to side, "A little."

That’s good enough for me, "Are you missing any medicine?"

"Si, I mean yes. After the baby came, a lot of pain." She holds the lower part of her stomach with her free hand. "How do you say?" she looks up clearly thinking of the words, "Ladron. A ladron." She looks at the confusion on my face, "A thief. Si, a thief. One momento." She carries the baby across the room to a faded black purse sitting on a mostly empty mantle and pulls out a piece of folder paper. She brings it back over and hands it to me. I recognize it immediately as a police report out of the 1st Precinct. The narrative reads as follows:

~


{\ttfamily
\Large
\raggedright


On November 4th between the hours of 10pm and 5am the next morning an unknown suspect or suspects entered the Saenz residence and took the prescribed medication, to wit approximately 28 cocaine pills, and the bottle that contained them. An investigation by myself revealed that a lock pick was most likely used to gain entry as there were no signs of entry through the windows (the screens were still on all of them). This case will be closed early due to a lack of evidence. Please replace Mrs. Saenz medication at your earliest convenience and let this report serve as a testament that a crime occurred.

I hand her report back to her and she shows me a new bottle, "Gracias." I say and she smiles back.

As I pass through the double doors into the tiled hallway I can see 1a on the left followed by a stairway. Directly across from 1a is 1b and on the same side a long red carpet fancies up the place stretching to 1c at the end on the right. A potted plant guards the top of a table at the end of the hall.

It is just as Stacy described it to me and I can see the front room just inside the open door. I still have my black winter gloves on and I replace them with the rubber ones from my briefcase. I check the inside of the door. Sure enough, I see blood on the inside handle. I induce that the murderer transferred the victim’s blood as they opened the door to flee. I examine the door closely and I can’t see any signs of damage to the door jam. The deadbolt is unlocked and doesn’t have any blood on it leading me to induce the killer didn’t touch the deadbolt as they fled.

The double doors to the apartment building seem to always be locked and seem quite solid so I can imagine a lot of these individual residents not having bothered to lock their deadbolt and may or may not lock their door handle lock. I look at the outside of the deadbolt and don’t see any scratches or signs of tampering. On 1c’s door handle that faces the hallway I can see two rather deep scratches as well as a lot of smaller shallower scratches near the keyhole. This may be someone missing the keyhole but the deeper scratches kind of makes me think it has been lockpicked. This is a potential entry point if the murderer wasn’t let in willingly but I take a note to check the windows as well.

As I step in the front room a wave of heat hits me to the point of discomfort. I unbutton my suit jacket to little relief but I have to push through the excessive heat. Now I know this person has money to own an oil-burning furnace when they just came out recently. A mat sits just inside the door and two pairs of low heels rest atop the mat.

The front room is furnished nicely and I can see that the occupant must be well off. A large window on the left spills light in. I note that at the time of the murder it would have been dark in here. The couch and loveseat are both covered in plastic as if to protect it. The coffee table has several "Time The Weekly News Magazines" with the one on top having Eugene O’Neill on the cover and "Number 18" printed in the bottom right corner. I think to myself that it’s redundant to have Volume XVIII on the bottom left of the same cover but I don’t design magazine covers. A large lamp sits on an end table by the couch. It is currently off.

I move further back through the large open kitchen and the heat doesn’t relent. Everything appears tidy and nothing is out of place except a white sheet lies crumpled on the floor. I photograph the sheet and check it for blood and there is none. I check the rest of the kitchen and see the wooden knife block on the counter. A 3" wide slot in the wood appears to be missing the butcher’s knife. The serrated bread knife, paring knife and six steak knives fill the other slots of the wooden block. It seems the murderer didn’t bring their own weapon. I take a photo of it and make a note of it.

The hallway is in the center of the back wall of the kitchen. There’s an open door on the left leading to a neat and tidy restroom. I open the medicine cabinet and the medicine bottles for Mira Murphy line the shelves in a neat and orderly fashion. Blood pressure medicine and the like are all that are here. Nothing that some of the people I’ve encountered on patrol would want or use. The large ornate bathtub is currently dry.

Straight ahead is a closed door with a screw sticking out at eye level and a clipboard hanging from it. I examine the clipboard and it is a list of times that medicine was administered. It is signed with an "X", a common signature for someone who can’t write, and note the "Time Given" is 9pm every night. I open the door and see a plain but lavish bedroom.

A very comfortable looking bed sits in the corner with the head of the bed against the left wall. All of the walls are decorated with Army medals and a large wooden dresser along the right wall has various papers, jewelry boxes and makeup that doesn’t look like it has been touched in a very long time. There is a shadow box with a 27th Infantry Division patch that I recognize as an Army Reserve unit out of New York, a Specialist Rank patch and a picture of a young soldier who looks to be in his early 20’s hanging on the back wall. The name Michael Murphy is seen on name patches as well as several certificates.

Inside the shadow box I recognize a golden heart shaped medal with George Washington in gold and a purple background to the heart all suspended from a purple ribbon. This Purple Heart means he was either wounded or killed in combat.

There is an elderly white woman, maybe in her late 80’s or early 90’s sleeping soundly in the bed and I can hear from here she’s breathing loudly. It appears with the bedside table filled with magazines, crosswords and puzzle books that this woman doesn’t get out of bed very often. Cavalier said the elderly woman was sleeping when she checked this room as well. I can’t imagine she saw anything but she may know the dead person.
\begin{itemize}
\item 
If you’d like to wake the elderly woman go here, go to \#\hyperref[sec:1{-}0210]{1{-}0210} on p.\pageref*{sec:1{-}0210}, then return here afterwards.

\end{itemize}

As I approach the open door across from the bathroom the smell of poor hygiene assaults my nose and the heat makes it much worse. I put my wrist to my face and the smell of rubber helps a little.

A four-poster queen size bed with a pink comforter and frilly white pillows along the top centered on the back wall. Blood decorates the comforter, ruining its inviting decor.

Two ornate bedside tables flank the bed on either side. The left bedside table has a well worn novel of "The Wizard of Oz" and a lamp that is currently on. The light spilling in the window is more than enough to light up the room and make the lamp obsolete. The window is locked and the screens are still on the outside. I note that the door is the most likely entry point for the murderer with no signs of the windows or screens being damaged.

A large vanity dresser with a mirror rests against the left wall. A dummy’s head on the vanity models a large black wig and various make-up lines the dresser top. A three drawer jewelry box appears to have had all three drawers opened and they are empty. I note the killer may have taken the jewelry before they left. On the right bedside table is a pill bottle.

A skinny white male approximately 5’10" lies on his back on the right side of the bed nearest the bedside table with the pill bottle. A large puncture wound appears on my right but his left and blood stains the white t-shirt. It appears the butcher’s knife he holds in his right hand missed his brown jacket and went through the white t-shirt, putting about a 3" wide cut in the shirt and in his chest. I photograph the knife and check the handle and note with the smeared blood that I am unable to get a print from it.

He’s wearing blue jeans but the button and fly are undone revealing his blue and black checkered boxers that appear to be low enough to show the top of his pubic hair. It’s definitely lower than would be normal for someone to wear them. One explanation is that he was changing or getting dressed when the killer stabbed him but I write it in my notes unsure of what to make of it. He has heavily deteriorated steel toe boots and dirty white socks on as well. The sole of the boots appear to be wet and I make a note of it.

I lift his body slightly to check behind him and it does not appear the knife went all the way through him but would have come close. His skin appears clammy as if he was sweating profusely prior to his death. He has large purple bags under both eyes giving me the impression he hasn’t slept in a while or possibly had a terminal illness. I take a picture of his face. The excessive sweating appears to support the terminal illness as well but it could also be due to excessive drug use. That brings me to the pill bottle sitting on the right bedside table.

I take a picture of the pill bottle. I record the information from the pill bottle. The name, "Gisela Saenz" appears on the badly torn label but it looks like the Pharmacist that filled the subscription starts with, "Ketchu…", the name of the medicine on the partial label says, "Co…" and the rest is torn off. I don’t know a lot of medications but cocaine or codeine are two I can think of that would fit the bill. I dust the bottle and reveal two prints. I carefully use clear tape to remove them and put them on two separate cards. A quick inspection reveals that they are not the same print.

Fingerprints are a special kind of evidence. In the full game (if added as proposed) there would be a picture of a fingerprint. You could compare it to all 100 fingerprint cards or you could go to the Fingerprint Specialist on the Day it was found to get the fingerprint category narrowed down and therefore eliminate some cards.;

The 100 fingerprint cards make up the same percentages. Cards 1-5 are Archs, Cards 6-70 are Loops and Cards 71-100 are Whorls.

\begin{displayquote}

After a day has passed from when you receive the fingerprint card you can visit the Fingerprint Specialist (so in this case, sometime during day 2) and he will have identified the fingerprint.
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

If you identify the fingerprint yourself. You would compare the fingerprint card that matches and check a chart in the back of the case book to get the name of the match, then you would Circle that Fingerprint OR when you go to the Specialist the next day and have the print identified you would put a Circle around the Evidence Letter to show it is identified.
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

A Lead may ask for a Square, a Circle or Both types of Evidence Letter. Ensure you have the right one before continuing with that lead.
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

Keep in mind that only someone that has been printed by the police after 1903 would be in AFIS (Automated Fingerprint Identification System). If there was no match of the 100 fingerprint cards that means that the print is not in the system. Because these 100 fingerprint cards have not been done yet you will have to wait until tomorrow and speak to the Fingerprint Specialist by going to the Fingerprint Identification Lab (under Police (NYPD) - Labs but he can still be spoken to today if you desire.
\end{displayquote}

\hrulefill

I walk around and pick up the Wizard of Oz novel and flip through it. It is heavily worn and opens naturally to the first page of Chapter 1. In the first line, "Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry." The word Dorothy is underlined and handwritten along the right edge of the page there are 2 rows that line up vertically.

01 02 03 …36

D  O  R …   9

I’m not sure what it means but I make a note of it and photograph it before I photograph the body.

I check his jeans pocket to see if he has any identification in a wallet or anything to help me identify him. His black wallet is worn and empty. A search of his jacket reveals trash and candy wrappers.

A quick search of the drawers to the vanity dresser reveals two dresses in two different brands, one sized medium and one sized large. I get the impression that this person may have an office job or something similar, but I can’t be sure.

I hear the coroner knocking on the door to 1c and go to meet him. He introduces himself as Walter Bessette. We walk through the house and I go over everything I have so far with him. We talk it over and I show him the two fingerprint cards. We both think that one of the fingerprints from the pill bottle probably belongs to the deceased and hopefully that will help identify him. I know the elderly woman is the resident but I feel like I should canvas the area to try to figure out for sure who the others might be.

I release the body to Doctor Walter Bessette, who currently has a mercury thermometer in his hand. He says when he’s done he’ll have the EMT’s transport and there’s a chance he can knock out the autopsy by tonight. "Feel free to stop by later and you may get lucky but don’t count on it. If nothing else I can give you my preliminary thoughts."

"Oh yeah, I found this book as well with this weird writing on it. What do you make out of that?" I open it and show him the edge of the first page.

"Not a lot, it definitely looks like some sort of cipher though. Did you find any coded messages?"

"No, I guess not."

"Well, if you want to know more I would speak to Robin in Counterintelligence, she knows her stuff."

I realize that a big part of my investigation is going to hinge on identifying my John Doe as well as the killer. I’m hoping identifying one of them will help lead to the identity of the other. I write down the notes of what I know about both of them so far.

\hrulefill

Mark [J] "Autopsy Request of -leave a space until you identify-". Note the Day it was found.

\begin{displayquote}

Autopsy requests are a special kind of evidence as well and therefore you should note the Day you put in this request. If you don’t get the autopsy at the End of Day Briefing then you can pick it up the next day. Sometimes if there’s a particularly important case that requires expedition then it may appear as a Late Night Lead or you may get it during the End of Day Briefing. That is not the case with this one because you still haven’t identified the killer. For an autopsy report go to the Forensic Autopsy Lab (under Police (NYPD) - Labs) the following day.

As I approach the dark gray door of 1a, it opens from the inside. In the doorway I catch sight of a bombshell blonde in a black silk nightgown that contrasts with her ivory skin. "Is there anything I can do to help you young man?" She purrs as she eyes me up and down. She catches me looking at her ensemble before we lock eyes. She grins amused. "Anything at all. Gina Schiavone, what can I do you for?"

It’s my first day in Major Crimes and I already want to take a vacation and get to know Gina but I have to focus. This is the kind of thing that can land a detective in hot water. "Ma’am, did you hear anything this morning, maybe around 6 o’clock?" I fight everything in my body to keep from breaking eye contact.

I see her frown an exaggerated frown as if she’s disappointed she doesn’t know anything, "I’m sorry sweetie, I was sleeping. I didn’t wake up until I heard the sirens. I swear those medics don’t go anywhere without making a bunch of noise doing it. I do hope everything is ok. Should I be worried?" She shakes her head and purses her lips into a pout as if she’s worried. She’s not.

"No ma’am, we’re just conducting an investigation. If you could stay in your apartment while we’re working that would be a mighty fine help."

"Ok, sweetie. Well If you need me, you know where I’ll be. Why don’t I put on a pot of coffee for us tonight and you feel free to come back and we can enjoy each other’s company. I know you’ll be tired after a long day of investigating and I think a pot of coffee will do you just fine." She turns as if to give me a view of what I’m missing and seems to delay looking back and I take in her whole body for my viewing pleasure before she looks over her shoulder catching my eyes wandering for the second time. She smiles coyly ,"I do hope to see you tonight.", and closes the door.

NY Times                               Sunday November 15, 1931

By Janine Steele

The NY Police reported that Friday’s stabbing victim at 10 Downing Street in Greenwich Village was the result of a botched break in. The police have assured that the public is safe and that the killer has been captured.

The police released this statement, "The deceased had attempted to burglarize a tenant of the apartment when he found a young lady and attempted to bring her harm. She defended herself and it resulted in Henry Phillip’s death. The prosecutor has come to the same conclusion as the lead detective in this case and has released the young lady early this morning with no charges."

The young lady was not available to be reached for comment.

The subway is quite busy with people going about their business. Most of them look like they are on their way to or from work. I see several rough looking individuals sitting off to the side on crates playing chess with a rough well worn set of pieces and a board drawn on a piece of cardboard. It looks serious enough that if they had money there would be money on the game but none of them do.

"Hello Gentlemen, I want to ask you fellas if you might know this man." I take out the mugshot photo of Henry Phillips and show it to them. None of them look impressed but all of them seem to recognize him.

"Henry Phillips, goes by the name Fips. He’s always around here now. I think he used to live in Hell’s Kitchen or Harlem or something. He couldn’t hold down a job when he started using coke and he was a whole other level of nitwittery [stupidity] when it came to chess. He’ll do anything for coke. He’s always breakin’ into people’s homes and taking whatever he gets his hands on; drugs, cash or hell I saw him trying to fleece someone to buy a toaster once that I know he had to have stolen. Are you going to tell me you own a toaster, but not a house? I don’t think so."

"You know how you can tell if he broke into your house?"

"How?" I ask as if I’m being baited.

"He has money." he laughs like he just gave the punchline of the best joke ever. "What’s he done now?"

"Well, I don’t think he’s going to be breaking into any more houses. I’ll put it that way, but we’re still conducting an investigation."

"Damn, that prick owed me money too." he turns back to his game and I thank them for their time as I pursue other leads. I’m even more confident I’ve identified the deceased subject, Henry Phillips.

"Sir, I collected this today. Have you had time to look at it?"

"I had a quick glance and it is by far the most common type of classification, a loop. A loop fingerprint has ridges that start from one side and then loop around to the same side creating exactly one triangular intersection, or delta, on the opposite side. Loop fingerprints like this make up about 65\% of all fingerprints.."

In the full game he would narrow your search down to fingerprint cards 6 through 70 as those are all this classification. You could then identify it yourself now. You would compare the fingerprint card that matches and check a chart in the back of the case book to get the name of the match, then you would mark (F) OR you could wait until the next day after you found it (it’s assumed you turn them in at the end of the shift whether you came here or not) and return here.

\label{sec:5{-}4202}\textbf{500 W 51st Street}%


I notice there are multiple boot prints piled onto each other in the snow leading up to this brick and timber house at 500 W 51st Street. I can’t make out any specific print to photograph.

A large white snow covered sign on the front lawn says, "For Sale by Atlantic National Bank." in big black letters. Written below that in much smaller letters it says, "Due to be auctioned on…" and the date looks to have been deliberately broken off.

There are no curtains or blinds covering the windows and I can see right inside. There is a large mattress on the ground in the living room along with some open cans of Pork and Beans, Peaches and Pears and a worn black flashlight. I notice a cardboard box flipped upside down with an extinguished candle and a large envelope that says ‘Wayne, My Love’ written in cursive.

The front door is locked with a real estate lock. I walk around the back and although the covered rear porch doesn’t offer any footprints in the snow, the sidewalk leading to the rear of the house does. I photograph the barefoot print and I measure it. It’s just as I thought, 10 ¾".

I enter the covered rear porch and a "Welcome" mat greets me. I can see a weak real estate lockbox has been broken off of the wooden backdoor. The lockbox is discarded and the door itself is still locked. The lockbox does not appear to have been opened before being discarded, almost as if the intruder didn’t need the key. The door knob itself looks old and shows a lot of small scratches that appear to have been due to someone missing the keyhole in the dark.I lift the mat and see a dust print in the shape of a key with a bronze colored house key.

I open the door and entered the abandoned house. No one is here, which makes sense because the key was under the mat and the lockbox wasn’t open. I look around briefly and I can tell that some of Juanita’s stuff is still here.

Seeing all these signs along with the barefoot prints makes me think I’ve found where my killer is hiding. The envelope with ‘Wayne, my Love’ on the front is also a good indicator. I open the plain cream envelope and realize this is a quality envelope that probably came from her workplace. I find the following typed message inside:

~

My Love,

I have no choice but to run but I love you and want us to run away together. I hope you remember how a keyed caesar cipher works. I think you know what our favorite key is:

05 03 03 08 x 04 08 x 35 8 14 \& 30 31 08 14 x 20 08 x 09 17 x

28 28 / 28 32 / 30 28 x 04 08 x 27 28 30 35 04 05


}

\hrulefill

If I’ve identified the John Doe and I’m able to identify where I need to go as well as when I need to be there to find Juanita (by solving the cipher) then I should end Day 2 with at least one empty Fatigue Box after I have visited all the other Day Time Leads I would like to follow.
\begin{displayquote}

Mark (?) "Wayne’s Cipher?" and note (?) is a Late Night Lead.
\end{displayquote}

\begin{displayquote}

Using the solved cipher add the numbers representing E + F , see what Letter is represented by this number in the cipher and that is the Evidence Letter that you should mark (?).

As I walk in Walter Bessette already has a brown file with "NYPD Forensic Autopsy Report" written in black sitting on the desk. The tab sticking above the file still says ‘John Doe’,  "On the desk." he yells through his doctor’s mask as he hovers over another stiff. I didn’t have time for the fingerprint comparison so you’ll have to run them by their lab if you haven’t already but your report’s there.

I open the report and start noting the important facts in the file:


{\ttfamily

\raggedright

\begin{displayquote}

The Time of Death is between 0530 and 0610, when the 1st Officer was on scene, or 0630 using body temperature and rigor alone and occurred on November 13th, 1931.
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

Wounds inflicted prior to death: 1x 3" wide vertically oriented puncture laceration that goes through the victim’s top 2 ribs, through the victim’s lungs and damaged the underside of the skin on the victim’s back, but did not puncture the rear skin. This wound is consistent with the butcher’s knife that was recovered in the victim’s right hand and has been deemed fatal in my expert opinion.
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

The cause of death is internal bleeding in the victim’s left lung caused by a puncture that caused the victim to effectively drown. This would be a quick unrecoverable death. The blood in the lungs is supported by the blood inside the deceased’s mouth and esophagus but not in the stomach.
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

The stomach appears to have been empty and testing reveals that food had not been consumed at least 24 hours prior to death.
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

The victim’s blood type is AB and approximately 150 ml of blood type O was recovered near the chest wound. It is my professional opinion that the suspect cut themself on the same knife used to inflict the fatal wound. This is consistent with AB and O blood types recovered from the knife.
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}

The toxicology report and hair follicle testing shows a recent history of cocaine and traces reported are consistent with the last usage over 48 hours prior to death, when breakdown ceases.

All the clothing items worn by the deceased; A Brown Jacket with no tags, a White Fruit of the Loom T-Shirt, Fruit of the Loom Boxers (Blue Plaid), White Socks and Black Steel Toe Boots show heavy signs of use, dirt and debris buildup consistent with homelessness and being worn multiple days in a row without washing.

This newly built house at 22 Gramercy Park S is the epitome of money, it matches the bank in terms of extravagance. I knock on the solid mahogany door to find a woman who introduces herself as Mrs Padovano and after some quick formalities she explains that I would be best to go to his work to meet him. She tells me he’s the Lending Manager at Atlantic National Bank and points towards the Northwest.

"Actually, I found a book at a recent homicide and it seemed like some sort of code was written inside. I was told you may be able to help." I take out my notes and show her what was on the first page of "The Wizard of Oz".

"Yes, I’ve seen these before. It’s definitely a cipher, most likely some sort of Caesar with the numbers and letters aligned but not in order like that with the numbers representing the letters. A lot of spies used ciphers like this to code their messages during the Great War. Although codes are common knowledge now so some people use them for fun."

"This one in particular I haven’t seen but it does appear to be some sort of Caesar Shift. If you leave it with me I can see if I can figure out more but right now there was no message that you found with it?"

"That’s correct, just the book."

She looks at it for less than a minute, "It looks like someone was using the first word, Dorothy, at the start and then you’d have the alphabet except no letters would repeat It seems like it would be a \textbf{keyed Caesar cipher} but it doesn’t quite follow that pattern."

"With these keyed Caesar ciphers both of the parties have to know the key word. In this case, ‘Dorothy’. You write the numbers 1-26 and then your key word or phrase and the rest of the alphabet without repeating letters so the second O in Dorothy would be removed. I’ve never seen one go higher than 26. It may be a different language or something but I don’t know of any off-hand with that many characters. With no message to try I guess it doesn’t matter."

I take out the two fingerprint cards I lifted from the pill bottle and compare it to the print Walter took from the John Doe. Sure enough, the second card, Evidence F, is a match. I induce that the pill bottle must have been handled by my homicide victim.

Do not change the [ ] or ( ) but note that Evidence F matches the John Doe’s fingerprint.

I put Walter’s fingerprint card for the John Doe back on the table. So my deceased did have the pill bottle. I wonder if the second set of fingerprints I found on the bottle belong to the killer or someone else entirely.

\label{sec:5{-}9903}\textbf{8th \& 34th St Subway}%


I arrive at 1am and settle in on a bench overlooking the platform for the 138am train. I open my New York Times and know that I look like a lot of the other commuters. It’s Sunday on the clock but the busy subway is overloaded with partygoers from Saturday night life. I have no reason to believe the train is running late and suspect Juanita and Wayne will arrive shortly to try to make her getaway. I hope to talk to her and get her side of events before that happens.

I see a lot of people that match Juanita’s description but none of them stand out at first. I don’t know what Wayne looks like but I continue to scan the crown anyway.

That’s when I see her, a 5’6" woman with mocha colored skin wearing a black beret, a green pastel dress covered in white flowers that just passes her knees and long loose sleeves and she’s nervously tapping a large suitcase. 110am seems like an odd time to be traveling. She keeps looking at the clock as if she’s waiting for someone. At first I think she has something in her right hand but then I see it is a tightly wrapped bandage.

A 5’10" colored man darker than Juanita approaches her wearing a tan trench coat covering a white button up shirt and tie. They embrace and he kisses her. I stand up to approach as I hear her say, "You came, you came. I’m so happy you…" she trails off as she sees me over his shoulder.

"What’s wrong Honey?" he says slowly turning towards me when she doesn’t answer.

"Miss Murphy, Wayne, NYPD Major Crimes." I hold up my badge, "We need to talk."

She looks at me in my suit and fedora holding my badge out. She starts to cry. "Let’s step over here away from everyone." I hold my arm out guiding them towards an unused subway tunnel and they both walk over with me.

Before I can say anything else she bursts out, "I’m so sorry for running. I’m just so scared. I don’t know what to do. You have to understand mister, I’ve never done anything like this."

"I don’t doubt that that’s the case ma’am. I know there’s two sides to every coin and I want to see which side your coin is on. I think it’s only fair if I listen to you. Please start from the beginning."

"It all started earlier this week. First thing Monday the bank foreclosed on my house and I had nowhere to go. My auntie is starting to lose it but with nowhere to go I had no choice but to ask if I could stay with her. I was afraid she wouldn’t remember me on account of her Alzeimers but she did, and she welcomed me. Over the last couple of nights there were times I would come home to the apartment and she wouldn’t know who I was at first but I needed to figure something out so I stayed anyway but was quiet. Her home nurse, Leisha, knew I was there and she knew my auntie didn’t mind. We even had a few talks at night."

"Anyway," she shifts uncomfortably as if unsure where to put her hands. I can see she still has tears on her cheeks and welled up in the corner of her light brown eyes. "I got off work Thursday. I’m a secretary here in the Village. I grabbed a couple of groceries on my way home for Auntie Mira and me cause I knew it was supposed to snow. She keeps it extremely hot in there and I woke up early the next morning and had to get a drink of water. I wrapped the sheet around me and went to the kitchen where I heard scratching at the door, like a mouse or something was in the wall. I know Auntie Murphy doesn’t have mice. Have you seen her apartment?" She looks at me and then realizes that of course I’ve seen the apartment.

"I realize someone is messing with the lock and in the shock I dropped my sheet and grabbed a kitchen knife from the knife block. I run back to my room and shortly after I hear the front door open. I don’t have time to go back so I lay on my right side in the bed with the knife under me."

"Sir, my auntie keeps it super hot in her apartment, and I," she stutters several times as if embarrassed about what to say, "I. I was only wearing my panties and I thought with the darkness maybe whoever it was would just burgle my auntie and leave. I didn’t dress like that on purpose, I wasn’t tryin’ to tempt anyone, I swear. My auntie sleeps soundly and I thought if they went in there where the valuables are they would just leave. I don’t have anything but a set of teardrop diamond earrings I inherited when mom passed away from pneumonia and her engagement ring for if I ever get married." She spins the gold ring on her bandaged right hand and starts sobbing again as I urge her to continue.

"Ma’am, I know he surprised you and that wasn’t your intention. It sounds like you haven’t done anything wrong up to this point and you need to know that. What happened next ma’am?"

"I pretended like I was asleep and lay on my right side facing the dresser and the vanity mirror and I heard his footsteps as he came into the room. It was very dark and I had my eyes partially closed but he had a flashlight so I could make out a little bit of him through my squinting."

I think back to the flashlight I saw at Juanita’s old house and I’m imagining that it was his.

He walked over to the dresser and opened my aunties jewelry drawers that I had my mom’s earrings in. Then her lip starts to quiver as if in fear and she doesn’t seem to be able to talk.

Wayne wraps his arms around her, "Tell him Honey. He needs to know." She looks at him and gets some of her composure back.

"That was when he shone the flashlight on me. I froze. I started praying he would see someone was in the room and he would just run off. But he didn’t. I closed my eyes tightly so he wouldn’t realize I was awake but I heard his steps getting closer to the bed. Then I heard the zipper on his pants and my heart was beating so loud I thought he would be able to hear it. He whispered, ‘You’re gonna like this girly." and I knew right then what his devilish intentions were and what I had to do. I felt the side of the bed sink as I heard the bed springs give way as he was getting on the bed."

"I couldn’t wait any longer and I opened my eyes and drove the knife two handed upwards with all my might. Me turning so fast must have startled him and with his hand down his pants fiddling himself, he couldn’t stop himself and fell on the blade.  When he fell on the blade my hands slipped down the knife and cut me but I was too scared to care." She holds up her bandaged hand.

His mouth and eyes opened wide in shock and I rolled him to my left to get him off of me. I was scared and frantic so I grabbed his flashlight that had fallen off the dresser and I threw on my fur robe and I ran."

"I’m sorry, I didn’t know what to do. I should have stopped when that Officer yelled at me but I was so scared. I know how it looks with a negro killing a white man but I swear it wasn’t on purpose. May God have mercy on my soul! This is something I have to live with for the rest of my life, however long that is. I know they’ll hang me for sure and that’s why I ran." She starts to sob and Wayne pulls her closer and he looks at me expectantly.

I realize I have an important decision to make regarding the fate of Juanita Murphy.

"I know you found him in the morning but you think he’s the only stiff in weather like this?" The no nonsense Coroner points at several bodies laid out on slabs that roll out of the wall. "Since you’re down here, I’m Walter Bessette in case you forgot. I got a few more stiffs after I left that apartment so I haven’t had time to look too much further with your case. We’re probably going to be seeing a lot of each so you knowing my name is fine but don’t be showing up at my house. We’re not that close and if I’m home it means I’m not here and that means I’m not on the clock."

"I did look over your John Doe though, that was the most interesting of the deaths we had last night. It seems like whenever there’s cold weather people start dropping like flies from every little thing that can get them. Some of them were frozen before they got to my freezer but you don’t care about that. There’s nothing special about them. Your guy on the other hand."

"I took his prints and I’m working on them, that might help us get him identified. I’ll have those results for you tomorrow and I’ll have performed the autopsy by then too so make sure you check back. It’s already Friday but guess who’s on all weekend. You guessed it, Walter ‘Your New Best Friend’ Bessette."

"Right now I only found the puncture but it’s deep and goes almost all the way through. I checked the blood types and it looks like I have some AB and some O blood types. That means whoever stabbed him, their hand probably slipped down the knife and they cut themselves as well so you’re looking for someone with a cut hand, probably their right hand from where the injury is on our victim. The AB blood is our dead guys but the O can’t be and there was quite a bit so it must have been a pretty good cut. I took his property out of his pockets and that will be on the report but he didn’t really have anything and his clothes were not in good repair. Even though he was dead I could still smell the body odor of this guy. I’m assuming he hasn’t showered in quite some time. It’s bad and I smell dead bodies for a living so you know it’s bad. Come back tomorrow and I’ll have my report.

"We got a hit on this one, Henry Phillips. He used to live at 320 West 201st Street in Apartment 2a. Of course that was before the long rap sheet of burglaries, drug possession and breaking and entering charges. As of the last contact with him about four weeks ago he’s homeless. Looks like Officer Barnes was the one that arrested him but he had a different partner then. Not sure who, but I know him and Cavalier just started partnering up last week. Where’d you find that print?"

"On a pill bottle the EMT’s said fell out of my dead man’s pocket when they were checking him."

"I took the courtesy of printing off what we have on Phillips and got you his most recent mugshot." The fingerprint analyzer  hands me a small file with a mugshot.

I look at the mugshot, "That’s him, looks like I’ve identified my dead guy. Now today I can focus on tracking down the killer the rest of the day. I’m afraid they might flee if I don’t track them down. Thanks for your help."

"No problem, if you get any more prints let me know."

I knock on the door to a small red brick and timber house on Bleecker St and a large negro woman in her 30’s and wearing a green pastel dress greets me, "What can I do for you sir?"

"Good morning NYPD," I set my briefcase down and flash my badge which she hardly looks at, "Are you the nurse for Miss Murphy on Downing Street?"

"I am indeed, is everything ok?"

"She’s fine ma’am, unfortunately there was a homicide in her apartment yesterday. You can be relieved It wasn’t her. She appears to have slept through it. Did you stop by there yesterday morning around say 6 o’clock in the morning?"

"Oh my god, that’s terrible. Was it her niece? I don’t work in the morning at Mira Murphy’s, I stopped by there Wednesday night and gave her her meds right on time at 9 o’clock sharp. You don’t want to be late with Miss Murphy’s meds, she’ll give you the what for and put in a complaint to the Agency." She smooths her dress to try to relax and continues, "If you get three strikes with the Agency they let you go. If I lose my job I can’t keep up with this place." She holds her hand out indicating the house behind her, "I’d invite you in but I’ve got to head over to another job and was just stepping out.." She locks the door. "Can I ask you who died then if it wasn’t Miss Murphy?"

"Well, we’re trying to figure that out ma’am. You asked if it was her niece, why would you think that?"

"She had moved in earlier in the week. She’s a colored woman like me and no offense but some people still treat us like it’s 70 years ago. She had told me about Atlantic National Bank foreclosing on her mortgage. I still can’t believe what that racist prick did, he up and gave her the boot cause of her skin color but I can’t prove it."

"I don’t know her name but the woman that adopted Juanita couldn’t be whiter and Juanita is most definitely colored like me, but unlike me she’s rather fit. That woman adopted her when she was about two and raised her like her own. Her parents were killed and I don’t right know how or why but I know it takes a special someone to take in a total stranger like that. The only thing I can tell you about Juanita’s real parents is that they went to the same church. They sat on opposite sides per the law but they still went to the same one. Somehow the two of them were killed and she said she had to take her in, it was only right. Most people were against it but it didn’t stop her at all. She’s stubborn, like her somewhat sister-in-law Mira. I say somewhat because Mira and Michael never officially got married and Michael is the actual brother."

"So why did you think it might be Juanita?"

"I’m so sorry, I get off track if I’m not brought around. The reason I asked about Mira’s niece, Juanita Murphy, is because she’s been staying with her since the bank foreclosed on the house. You see, her mom passed away and left her the house and the mortgage. That poor girl, she’s a secretary or a receptionist maybe. I believe somewhere in Hell’s Kitchen and her work got in a spot and they said they couldn’t pay until some commission checks came in. She thought she’d be good because it would only be about two weeks late. Two weeks rolled around and they said they still didn’t have the commissions. The bank was breathing down her neck but she just didn’t have it. It wasn’t until the end of the third week when they finally gave her the pay she was owed. By then Atlantic National had decided to snatch her house right out from under her. She told me she begged and pleaded and would even give them a late fee but he laughed to her face. She was devastated and went to Miss Murphy for help."

"Miss Murphy is nothing like that bank scum and would do anything for anyone. Just like her sister that took in Juanita."

"Do you know where the house was?"

"No idea of the address. Somewhere in Hell’s Kitchen. From what she told me that’s the worst part, the local bank foreclosed and it’s a crummy neighborhood and it’s just sitting there vacant right now. They wouldn’t accept her late payment and so she turned to Miss Murphy and Miss Murphy may be older than Jesus but she’s a heart of gold just like the Heavenly Father himself. Took her in right away."

"How long has she been living with Miss Murphy?"

"Less than a week now. Maybe since Sunday or Monday. I didn’t see her when I took Miss Murphy her nighttime meds last night. You don’t think she’s involved in this do you?"

"I’m not really sure. I definitely want to speak to her though." I change my questioning to avoid talking about Juanita Murphy because right now I’m unsure of her involvement in this man’s death.

"Was there a male living there too? Maybe Juanita’s boyfriend or a nephew of Miss Murphy?"

"Nope, just the two of them. I don’t know any males that have ever lived there and Juanita has never brought her boyfriend to Miss Murphy’s. Miss Murphy never got married. Her childhood sweetheart went to the Great War and didn’t make it back. I know it still bothers her. His platoon came across a bunker and he didn’t survive. She has some of his service medals hanging in her room. It’s sad really with her Alzeimer’s how she forgets what happened to him. It’s painful watching her realize the truth when she looks around sometimes but she says she wouldn’t want it any other way. Something about true love. She told me once that that was why she took his last name, even though they never had a chance to marry."

"Do you know the boyfriend’s name?"

"Can’t say I do, not the whole thing anyway. What was funny is that I know their favorite song. I had talked to Juanita that first night she had moved in and ‘Dream a Little Dream of Me’ had come on the radio and she told me how it was their favorite song. She told me she thought it was only her boyfriend Wayne’s favorite song because he shared the same first name as the singer. Anyway, she told me she wouldn’t bring him over because she was afraid it would scare her aunty."

"Now if you don’t have any more questions for me I have to run. Please figure out who did this as I’m sure Miss Murphy will be riled up again tonight. I thought she was talking crazy last night but I guess she was given it to me straight. Good day, Sir."

"Thank you, and good day to you too ma’am."

I’m confident that when I show the evidence to the prosecutor they will see it the same as me, that you were just trying to escape a horrible situation that Henry Phillips put you in. Overall, it will be up to them if they bring charges against you but I’m going to make sure you get a fair shake."

She stops sobbing and turns around for me to put the handcuffs on her. "Do you really think I can get a fair shake in court?"

"I truly do ma’am. It may feel like I’m against you but I truly feel this is what’s best for you. If I let you go on the run, I would have to sign a warrant for you. It’s true, you may never get caught if you keep your head down but that’s no way to live for the rest of your life. If you did run and then get caught later, I think it would look really bad for you and you’d be unlikely to get a fair trial at that point."

"New York Police," I say flashing my badge, "Did you see or hear anything Friday morning?"

He turns and sees me and a very disapproving look crosses his face. "I didn’t see anything but I heard everything. One of your Officers was yelling and blowing his whistle like a fucking canary. Woke me and my wife."

I have a feeling that if the door wasn’t already closed he would slam it for emphasis. "Ok, thank you Sir. Have a better day."

He huffs and continues about his day. I think I need to focus on other leads.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth, height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{E:/MyDocs/Programming/Python/hlweb2/hldjango/media/games/3_8cc64ae6-1d77-11ef-935f-24418c05e14f/uploadsStory/Washington-Square-Park-Winter_small.jpg}\end{center}


I walk over to Washington Square Park and it is full of large trees currently covered in snow. I’m able to make out various prints including the barefoot prints in a few places before it meets the sidewalk. There are sidewalks going straight to the center of the park and another sidewalk that circles the outside probably for walkers or joggers. I’m guessing the sidewalks had been shoveled or maybe the snow just didn’t stick on the warmer sidewalk but they are already clear.

I take my time scouring the park walking towards the center of the park where a large circular fountain takes residence. Trying to pick up the barefoot prints where they left the sidewalk seems impossible. I see why Barnes lost the suspect. I almost feel bad for how upset he was that they got away. With the little lead they had on him it would have been easy to duck out of sight.

I get to the circular fountain in the center of the park and it has been drained for the season. Currently a thin layer of snow has covered the inside of the fountain. I look to the North of the fountain and see the iconic white marble arch of Washington Square Park. The arch is flanked at its base by a statue of Washington on both sides and an eagle sits on the keystone of the arch.

I think about how close Barnes must have been to the culprit. I’m sure the killer must have gotten off the path rather quickly because he would have spotted them on the straight sidewalk leading to the fountain and arch. I’m guessing the two of them came in from the Southwest sidewalk. I start walking back thinking I must have missed when they stepped off the sidewalk.

I get almost halfway back when I see what I’m looking for. Off to the North of the path several barefoot prints lead into some bushes. I take a photo of the prints and then I follow them. There’s a large bush and it appears the culprit went behind the bush and then there are several prints almost in the same spot as if the person was hiding there for a while and shifting their weight. The prints then go off and meet with the Northwest snow free sidewalk. I look up and see the bus stop at the corner of Washington Square North and Washington Square West. I’m confident the culprit would have got on a bus. I start to walk that way and as I near the bus stop I see a flaw in my belief. The trees were blocking several taxi’s lined up on Washington Park North waiting for fares. Now I’ve got two possibilities, a taxi or a bus.

I knocked on 2b’s door a few times but there’s no answer. At first I think someone is coming to the door but then I realize it’s some sort of small dog’s toenails clicking on the wooden floors inside. I’m guessing a miniature greyhound but maybe that’s just because of Barne’s statement about the rabbit and the greyhound earlier. I hear the animal sniffing at the gap below the door.

This apartment is not directly above 1c, but is diagonally above it so the resident may have heard something if they were home. They would have to go to the first floor to leave but with 1c tucked away in the corner they may not run into each other very much. I guess I won’t know unless I come back tonight.

I knock on 1b and a large Russian man with grease streaks on his face and hands answers the door towering over me. "Yes?" He is short with me and I like that at this hour.

"Sir, Are you Chakan Yefremova?" I say pointing at the mail boxes.

"Yeah, what’s going on?" He folds his arms across his chest, his thick Russian accent coming through. With his muscles on top of muscles I can tell I wouldn’t want to find him in a dark alley and not call him a friend.

"I’m investigating a murder that occurred early this morning in this building. It seems to have happened sometime after 6am. Did you see or hear anything odd around then?"

He shrugs as if he has nothing to tell me and scrunches his brow as if thinking. "As I was leaving for work I saw a man running up to the double doors here." He points to his left to the main double doors to the apartment building. He seemed like he was in a hurry and it was snowing so I held the door open for him. He had a thick brown coat and was wearing blue jeans. I’ve never seen him before but there’s a lot of apartments in the building so I just figured he was visiting one of them. As he ran through the open doors he said, ‘Thanks, I’m here to see Mrs Murphy.’

I found that odd because Miss Murphy has never been married but I figured he could have just been helping her Nurse, Leisha Mooney, and not know any better. Sometimes Leisha has to do something and they send someone else over to help. I’m a mechanic and I was at work all day and didn’t get back till the streetlights came on."

"Well thank you for your time Mr Yefremova. Oh, before I go. What time was it that you left for work this morning?"

"555am. I always leave at the same time cause I have to catch the 608am train."

"Thanks." I say "Have a good night."

He grunts approvingly and closes the door.

I realize if this is true Cyril wouldn’t have been home and lives above and on the opposite side of 1c so I doubt she knows anything about the case today but she could still know about Miss Murphy. I don’t hear any noise coming from the apartment and don’t believe there’s any benefit to knocking. Maybe I should be thorough though.

\label{sec:7{-}7336}
The slick sidewalk of packed snow doesn’t manage to bring me down on my way to the 6th  Precinct. I walk in and see an officer in his long sleeve uniform with five stripes on the sleeves (at least 25 years of service) at the desk sipping a coffee that still has steam coming off of it. The chill that was outside seems barely noticeable as the excitement of the case warms me. I share a nod with the veteran officer and walk towards my new desk. I put everything away with plenty of time to get to Roll Call on time at 0700 hours.

Standing at the back of the room about 15 men and women of patrol come in and sit down. A couple of new recruits stand at the back with me. I can see their nerves and estimate they’ve been with their field training officers less than two weeks out of the academy.

A rotund no-nonsense sergeant sits at the front of the room addressing everyone but locking eyes with me, "Sir, you may be a green detective, but you’re not a green officer. Have a seat, I don’t think Captain Hunter would have sent us someone that wasn’t capable." He smiles and I relax a little. "Now have you earned your name? No, I don’t think so. So for now, you’ll be known as Detective. Does that work for you, Detective?"

"Yes, Sir. Thank you." I sit at the back desk in a metal chair that seems like it’s fit for a school classroom. I see a smile cross Lieutenant Hoffbaur’s face. I can’t tell if he thinks I handled the situation well or not but I have to think a smile is a good thing.

The sergeant tells the officers the beats they’ll patrol today and then he passes roll call over to the lieutenant. He starts by giving a short brief on the crimes last night. He’s going in chronological order and so far nothing but property crimes and family troubles, nothing major.

The last incident he has to tell us about he gets everyone’s attention by saying, "If you don’t think paying attention while you’re in your beat is important then you shouldn’t expect any commendations either. I’m sure two of third shift’s officers will have commendations coming their way for discovering this last crime."

"Just after 0600 hours this morning Patrolman Barnes and Cavalier were on foot patrol and realized something was wrong at an apartment building in their beat. One of them chased a suspect and the other located a stabbing victim. Sure, we don’t have either identified yet but that’s why we have our new detective." Everyone looks at me, "Looks like you’ve got your first case Detective. Grab what you need and head over to the 10 Downing Street Apartments. That’s not just the address, it’s also the name of the apartment building. I guess it’s named after some fancy London building that houses their Prime Minister. We need to ID the deceased and get on the trail of that suspect as quickly as we can before they flee for good."

\hrulefill
\begin{displayquote}

Use what you’ve learned to look up the 10 Downing Street Apartments in Greenwich Village, write the Lead \# on your Case Log and then turn to the matching number in this Case Book to go there. After you read the entry for the Apartment itself you are free to go where the leads take you. You should keep track of which leads you’ve already visited as well as the ones you plan to visit later (don’t forget to mark them when you’ve gone there). If at any time you forget what was said or need to look back at a previous lead you can do so at no penalty. Good luck on your first case Detective!"

"You still stuck eh?" she says with a light tease in her voice. "You know I thought about this and at first the 36 didn’t mean anything. Then I thought, that’s 10 places higher than the alphabet. Then the only thing I could think of that was exactly 10 digits is the numbers 1-9 and then 0. The most confusing part would be, is the 0 before or after the digits 1-9?"

I knock on 2b’s gray door and hear the tell-tale clicks of a small dog but this time I hear someone else coming to the door. After a short wait I am greeted by a black mustached olive-skinned man that introduces himself as Orio Lucchese and his little dog, a light gray Italian Greyhound. I can’t help but laugh to myself and feel like a little victory with my guessing skills.

"Sir, I’m not sure if you heard but someone was murdered in your building early this morning. I’ve been assigned to the case and wanted to ask you some questions. Is that ok?" I say as I take off my fedora and hold it against my stomach.

"I didn’t kill nobody." he says matter of factly.

"Sir, I don’t think you did. I just wanted to know if you saw anything suspicious around say 6 o’clock this morning?"

"Can’t say I did. If that was you that knocked earlier then I was trying to sleep because I worked till early this morning.  I didn’t get up till almost noon today. I had some drinks after work with some of my employees and then got to the station about 245am and came straight home cause it was starting to snow and no offense, but I was fucking cold. I work at an Italian eatery in Italian Harlem. I’m a co-owner with Forlini’s son. You’re welcome to stop in and check up on me, maybe grab you a slice while you’re there. But I didn’t see nothing."

"And do you know anyone that has been staying with Miss Murphy?"

"Can’t say I do but I don’t have a lot of time to mingle with my neighbors."

"Well thank you Sir. Have a good night."

"Ma’am, can you tell me anything about 1c downstairs?" I say as I show her my badge.

"That’s just it, Sir. I woke to someone screaming and it sounded like it was from the apartment below me. Sounded like a man that was surprised. It was loud and over before I fully woke. I turned and Benny was already gone. He leaves about fifteen after one every morning to get the subway to his bakery, Gingerbread Dreams. I opened my door to the hallway and listened and I heard someone running through the downstairs hallway but I was only wearing my night slip so I didn’t step out too far and I didn’t see anyone. When I went back inside my apartment I looked at the clock and it was exactly 607am. I couldn’t go back to sleep so I’ve just been pottering around the house all morning and baking." She holds her hands out and I see some of the dough on her hands.

"I’ll let you get back to it then ma’am. Thanks for your time today." I say and make my way to the next lead as she closes the door.

I speak to them and they tell me that two "coppers" stopped and talked to them this morning and told them it was ok for them to play chess here as long as they stayed out of everyone’s way. "I like them two, I don’t like you." One of the skinny men says, not taking his eyes off the chess game.
