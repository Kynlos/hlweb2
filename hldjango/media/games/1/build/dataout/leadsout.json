Record this information on your Case Log sheet (bottom right).  Start a new Lead Notes sheet for each day, and record every lead that you visit, along with the (starting) time of each visit.\nWhen you read a lead in the story book, you will be told the duration of that lead.  Add this duration to the current time and write this new time on the next blank line; this will be the starting time for the next lead you visit.\n. Note: Looking up a lead that is not found in the story book does not cause time to pass.\n~\n**Ending your Day**\nWhen each day begins, you will be given a list of items (typically Markers) that **must** be found before you can move on to the next day.  If you find all of these items *before* the designated day end time, you may keep playing until you reach the end time for the current day. Then move on to the day's end-of-shift briefing.\n~\n**Overtime**\nIf the current time passes beyond the designated end time for the day, but you have **not** found all of the day's items, then the next lead you visit will trigger *Overtime*. When this happens, mark the checkbox on your Case Log that indicates that you have entered overtime (OT) for the current day, and mark **5** demerit checkboxes.\nNow, for the remainder of the day, you will no longer record the time of lead visits. The clock no longer advances, and you ignore all storybook instructions to do so for the remainder of the day. Note:\n. If you encounter lead text that asks what the current time is while you are in overtime, you should consider the current time to be the day's end time.\n. If you are in overtime and find all of the required items, your day ends.\n~\n**Flextime Mode**\nFlextime mode is an optional way to play for those who dislike having to micro-manage the passage of time.\n. Ignore all time tracking instructions during the game. Do not record lead times or track the current time. Take as long as you want on each day. You are never in overtime.\n. Should you encounter text asking you what time of day it is, simply pick a time of your choice which is: 1) Within the start and end time for day, and 2) Later than any previously chosen time on the same day.\n. You may not move on from the current day before you find all of the day's required items; after you find them you may continue the day for as long as you like.\nPlaying in Flextime mode may reduce the tension you experience but will not otherwise reduce the richness of your experience, and may be more enjoyable for people who would rather focus on the narrative experience without being distracted by record keeping.\n~\n**Wrapping-up**\nNote that after the last day of your case ends, you will proceed to a conclusion section, but you will have a final opportunity to resume searching for leads without any time limit.",

If you find all of these items *before* the designated day end time, you may keep playing until you reach the end time for the current day. Then move on to the day's end-of-shift briefing.\n~\n**Overtime**\nIf the current time passes beyond the designated end time for the day, but you have **not** found all of the day's items, then the next lead you visit will trigger *Overtime*. When this happens, mark the checkbox on your Case Log that indicates that you have entered overtime (OT) for the current day, and mark **5** demerit checkboxes.\nNow, for the remainder of the day, you will no longer record the time of lead visits. The clock no longer advances, and you ignore all storybook instructions to do so for the remainder of the day. Note:\n. If you encounter lead text that asks what the current time is while you are in overtime, you should consider the current time to be the day's end time.\n. If you are in overtime and find all of the required items, your day ends.\n~\n**Flextime Mode**\nFlextime mode is an optional way to play for those who dislike having to micro-manage the passage of time.\n. Ignore all time tracking instructions during the game. Do not record lead times or track the current time. Take as long as you want on each day. You are never in overtime.\n. Should you encounter text asking you what time of day it is, simply pick a time of your choice which is: 1) Within the start and end time for day, and 2) Later than any previously chosen time on the same day.\n. You may not move on from the current day before you find all of the day's required items; after you find them you may continue the day for as long as you like.\nPlaying in Flextime mode may reduce the tension you experience but will not otherwise reduce the richness of your experience, and may be more enjoyable for people who would rather focus on the narrative experience without being distracted by record keeping.\n~\n**Wrapping-up**\nNote that after the last day of your case ends, you will proceed to a conclusion section, but you will have a final opportunity to resume searching for leads without any time limit.",

These days it\u2019s almost easier to sleep in my chair than in my bed.  I\u2019m just dozing off when I hear a knock at the door.\r\nThere\u2019s just enough of a pause to give me time to push my hat back and pretend I\u2019m awake.  In walks Jewel with a stack of papers in her hand, trailed by a lady I don\u2019t recognize.  She looks to be in her early 40s.  She\u2019s well put together, with matching black hat and handbag, and shiny black heels.  Looks like she\u2019s from money -- my favorite kind of client.\r\n\"This is Mrs. Browning,\" says Jewel. \"She wants to hire you to find something or other.\"\r\nI stand up and stick out my hand. \"Nice to meet you, Mrs. Browning,\" I say, and she puts her white-gloved hand in mine.\r\n\"I\u2019ll take it from here,\" I say to Jewel, who\u2019s already headed for the door.\r\n\"If she\u2019s looking for a bird, don\u2019t take the job,\" she says over her shoulder.\r\n\"You\u2019re not, are you?\" I say to Mrs. Browning.\r\n\"Not what?\" she asks.\r\n\"Looking for a lost bird.\"\r\n\"Who are you, Sam Spade?\"\r\nA big grin forms on my face, and I sit back down in my chair.  She may be from money, but I like her already.  \"No\", she says, \"I\u2019m looking for a book\".\r\nShe sits down in the chair opposite my desk and digs into her handbag for a cigarette.  I know how this goes, so I just wait for her to get settled and start talking.\r\n\"It\u2019s a very rare and valuable book, Mr. Deverell.  One that\u2019s been in my family for generations.  It\u2019s been stolen, and I want you to get it back for me.\"\r\n\"Sounds like a job for the police,\" I say.\r\nShe rolls her eyes and leans forward to tap her cigarette in my ashtray.  \"I just came from the police -- they\u2019re the ones who sent me to you.\"\r\n\"I see.\"  I loosen my tie and pull out the ledger from my desk drawer.  \"Well, my rate is 50 dollars a day plus expenses -- and that\u2019s whether I recover the book or not.\"  What I don\u2019t say is that my normal rate\u2019s 40 dollars a day; the extra 10 is my matching-hat-and-handbag rate.  \"If that suits you, we can get started right away.\"\r\n\"That will be just fine,\" she says.\r\n\"OK, start from the beginning, tell me about this book and what you think happened to it.\"\r\n\"Very well,\" she says, rummaging into her handbag.  \"This is a photo of the book.\"  She hands me a photo of an ornate book, indicating that I can keep it.\r\n\"It\u2019s an Octavo King James Bible. It was purchased by my great-great-great-grandfather in 1700.\"  She hesitates for a moment, like she\u2019s choosing her words carefully.  \"You must understand, Mr. Deverell, that I come from a deeply religious family -- this book has been smuggled across oceans and deserts, and passed down from generation to generation, from mother to daughter to daughter.  And now it\u2019s been stolen. I must have it back.  It is of incalculable sentimental value.\"\r\n\"I guess it\u2019s got some non-sentimental value, as well.\"\r\nShe wrinkles her mouth.  \"It is worth a small fortune.  Though that is of little concern to me.\"\r\nShe takes a long drag of her cigarette and continues.\r\n\"I came down from Boston the day before yesterday, to have it appraised -- for insurance purposes, you understand.  I had appointments yesterday with two dealers that had come highly recommended.  The first, a fellow named Wyckoff.  An older gentleman, perhaps 60 years old, tall, white hair, and walks with a limp.  He arrived at my hotel room around 8am.  He studied the book for about 30 minutes, then asked to take the book home with him overnight so he could study it further.  I told him that was out of the question.\r\nThe second dealer was a Mr. Gorski, who came by around 10am. He was a tiny man, Polish maybe, in his 40s or 50s, with a round balding head and wire-rimmed glasses. He spent a good hour going over the book with a magnifying glass, and said he would get back to me with his assessment.  He also requested that he be permitted to take the book back to his apartment to study it.  I again said no.  That was yesterday.  This morning I went out for breakfast -- I couldn\u2019t have been gone for more than an hour -- and when I returned to the room, the book was gone.\"\r\n\"So it was taken from your hotel room this morning.  You\u2019re quite sure of that?\"\r\n\"Quite.\"\r\n\"And you\u2019ve no doubt talked to the hotel staff already?  Could a maid have walked off with it?\"\r\nShe taps her cigarette into the ashtray.  \"I\u2019ve talked to the hotel staff.  They claim that the maid was nowhere near the room while I was out.\"\r\n\"Nothing else disturbed?\" I ask.  \"Nothing else taken?\"\r\n\"Some jewelry in a nightstand drawer was also taken -- ruby earrings and a matching ruby and silver necklace and bracelet, but they are of no importance to me.  There was cash and traveler\u2019s checks on the entryway table that were untouched.\"\r\n\"And where is it you\u2019re staying?\" I ask.\r\n\"The Hotel Cumberland in Times Square.  Room 713.\"\r\n\"I guess that rules out someone coming in through the window.  Any sign of someone messing with the lock to your door?\"\r\n\"I\u2019m sure I have no idea.\"\r\n\"OK, Mrs. Browning, I think that gives me enough to get started.\"  I stand up and show her to the door.  \"I can reach you at the Cumberland?\"\r\n\"Yes, you can call directly up to room 713 by dialing ",

I told him that was out of the question.\r\nThe second dealer was a Mr. Gorski, who came by around 10am. He was a tiny man, Polish maybe, in his 40s or 50s, with a round balding head and wire-rimmed glasses. He spent a good hour going over the book with a magnifying glass, and said he would get back to me with his assessment.  He also requested that he be permitted to take the book back to his apartment to study it.  I again said no.  That was yesterday.  This morning I went out for breakfast -- I couldn\u2019t have been gone for more than an hour -- and when I returned to the room, the book was gone.\"\r\n\"So it was taken from your hotel room this morning.  You\u2019re quite sure of that?\"\r\n\"Quite.\"\r\n\"And you\u2019ve no doubt talked to the hotel staff already?  Could a maid have walked off with it?\"\r\nShe taps her cigarette into the ashtray.  \"I\u2019ve talked to the hotel staff.  They claim that the maid was nowhere near the room while I was out.\"\r\n\"Nothing else disturbed?\" I ask.  \"Nothing else taken?\"\r\n\"Some jewelry in a nightstand drawer was also taken -- ruby earrings and a matching ruby and silver necklace and bracelet, but they are of no importance to me.  There was cash and traveler\u2019s checks on the entryway table that were untouched.\"\r\n\"And where is it you\u2019re staying?\" I ask.\r\n\"The Hotel Cumberland in Times Square.  Room 713.\"\r\n\"I guess that rules out someone coming in through the window.  Any sign of someone messing with the lock to your door?\"\r\n\"I\u2019m sure I have no idea.\"\r\n\"OK, Mrs. Browning, I think that gives me enough to get started.\"  I stand up and show her to the door.  \"I can reach you at the Cumberland?\"\r\n\"Yes, you can call directly up to room 713 by dialing #[7-9422](#7-9422).\"\r\nThen, with the first sign of real concern I\u2019ve seen from her, she says \"Until the book is recovered I dare not return home.  Oh, if you do find the book, Mr. Deverell, please be very careful with it -- it\u2019s several hundred years old and in very fragile shape -- the less you handle it the better.\"\r\n%boxstartred%\n%Symbol.Doc%You may now access [Document 1 (Photo of Mrs. Browning\u2019s Book)](#Document_1+p) from the back of this book; record this fact in your case log (unless you had gained access earlier).\n%boxend%\n\r\n\n~\n%boxstart%\n%Symbol.Mark% The following **5** items must be found before you may end **day 1**.

Jewel and I hop the train to 79th Street on the Upper West Side.\r\nThe midnight gala event at the museum is a pretty ritzy affair.  I\u2019m not sure how Jewel managed to get us tickets at the last minute, but she\u2019s resourceful like that.  As we\u2019re walking up the steps we see mayor Fiorello La Guardia, already inside shaking hands with someone, his pudgy face and rotund body exuding unmistakeable charm.\r\n![image](images/MuseumNaturalHistory2.jpg|height=6in)\r\nThe Museum of Natural History is one of my favorite places.  It\u2019s an awe-inspiring place. Dozens of dimly-lit rooms, with giant life-sized dioramas of cavemen and dinosaurs, pottery and tablets from the beginning of civilization, and sparkling gemstones the size of your head.\r\nJewel seems just as interested as I am, and we leisurely walk to the religious book exhibit, separated by only a few feet of space but a million years of daydreaming.\r\nThe controversial book exhibit itself is mildly interesting.  I\u2019m half-expecting to see a copy of Mrs. Browning\u2019s book on display, but no dice.  There\u2019s a big section discussing religious books from different cultures, and how each one was treated as blasphemous and sacrilegious by others, despite their common themes.  And there\u2019s a section of shockingly vibrant paintings of Hindu gods that defy description.  I make a note to myself to dig out my oil paints when I get home.\r\nThere is a section on controversial Christian Bibles, but they seem to be mostly about misprinted editions. The \"Wicked\" Bible, otherwise known as the \"Sinner\u2019s Bible\", was published in 1631 in London, where they accidentally left out the word \"not\" from the sentence \"Thou shalt not commit adultery.\"  Ouch.  Most copies were destroyed, making it highly valuable.  But there\u2019s no hint of any controversy related to Mrs. Browning\u2019s book.\r\n\"Pretty fascinating stuff, huh, Jewel?\"\r\nJewel doesn\u2019t hear me; she\u2019s lost in thought.  We wander around a bit more in silence, then part ways and head to our respective homes.\r\n",

On the wall of the showroom there\u2019s a big ornate wooden crucifix.  Through the doorway to the back room I can see a smaller one mounted on the office wall, as well as a large black floor safe.  But I can\u2019t see all the way inside to tell if there\u2019s anyone in there.  In the showroom, at the front desk, is a well-dressed old man with thinning white hair and a big smile.  He seems genuinely excited to chat about locks and safes.\r\nI introduce myself and look around the showroom a bit, thinking about whether we could use a safe for the office.\r\n\"Let me ask you something,\" I say.  \"How hard would it be to get into a hotel room door? How long would it take?\"\r\n\"I suppose it depends,\" he says, \"on whether it\u2019s the Waldorf Astoria or some rinky-dink hotel, and on whether you wanted it done properly or it was a rush job.\"\r\n\"Could I hire you to open a hotel room door for me?\" I ask.\r\nThere\u2019s a long pause and he seems to be sizing me up, then he takes a step backward and says \"Well, only if you\u2019re the hotel manager.\"  Behind him I see a younger gentleman peer out of the back room doorway, brushing back his long brown hair.\r\n\"Everything OK out there, Pop?\"\r\n\"You sure you\u2019re a P.I.?\" the old man asks.\r\n\"Well, that\u2019s what it says in the phone book.\"\r\n\"A comedian too, huh?\" and he gives a big grin.\r\nWe both chuckle, and I head out.\r\n",

I\u2019ve got a supply of coffee and cigarettes, but I\u2019m hoping this won\u2019t be an all day affair.  The only problem with the place I\u2019ve chosen is I\u2019m getting occasional nasty looks from passers-by.  One big guy across the street looks like he\u2019s fixing to come over and heave me out of my hidey-hole, but then thinks better of it when he sees I\u2019m settled in with my coffee and won\u2019t be easy to dislodge.  I guess it\u2019s true that they don\u2019t take kindly to loitering in Turtle Bay.\r\nMeanwhile I\u2019m looking for someone that matches Gorski\u2019s description -- short, balding, with wire-rim glasses.  Then I just have to figure out what to do if he shows up to pick up his mail.\r\nAn hour in, I see someone head to the entrance who looks out of place.  It\u2019s definitely not Gorski.  He\u2019s wearing a tan suit and hat.  Clean shaven.  Tall and skinny, with a pencil moustache.  There\u2019s something odd about the way he\u2019s carrying himself, though -- he\u2019s not walking like he\u2019s heading home, he\u2019s walking like he\u2019s just making a quick stop.\r\nA couple of minutes after coming in the front door, he\u2019s out again, stuffing envelopes into his jacket pocket.  Bingo.  I don\u2019t know who this guy is, but there can\u2019t be much doubt he\u2019s just gone and collected Gorski\u2019s mail for the week.  I decide to tail him.\r\nHe heads back down 52nd Street, the way he came.  He\u2019s on the north side of the street, and I\u2019m across the street on the south side, maybe 500 hundred feet behind him -- half a block away.  Not many people on the street this far east, but if he keeps going west I\u2019m going to have to close some ground if I don\u2019t want to lose him.\r\nSure enough he keeps heading west, across 2nd Avenue, and then right past the 17th Precinct, where he doesn\u2019t skip a beat.  I\u2019m trying to pick up my pace but he\u2019s still a couple hundred feet in front of me, and when he gets to Lexington he crosses the street against the light, then turns left, and I lose sight of him.\r\nI jog to the corner as inconspicuously as I can in a suit and hat, and look to the left, but I don\u2019t see him.  He can\u2019t have gone far -- but where did he go?\r\n",

                    "text": "\r\nWyckoff\u2019s Rare books  is one of those New York bookstores that feels like it\u2019s out of a movie.  It has a spooky feel, with antique light-bulbs and a maze of 10ft-high floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, all cramped into a footprint that can\u2019t be more than 20ft by 20ft.\r\nI find the proprietor, an old white-haired gentleman, limping down one of the rows with a large blackened tome in his hand and searching for a place to put it.  It looks heavy, but he doesn\u2019t seem to be having any trouble carrying it.  He finally shelves it next to another large book -- this one red, with what looks like a child\u2019s drawing of a skull on the cover.\r\n\"You must be Mr. Wyckoff,\" I say.\r\nHe looks me up and down as if sizing me up.  \"And who are you?\" he says.\r\n\"I\u2019m Jack Deverell, Mr. Wyckoff.  I\u2019ve been hired by a Mrs. Browning to help locate a lost book.  I\u2019m told you met with her on Sunday to appraise it.  An old Bible.\"\r\n\"*An old Bible!* **Ha!** Is that how she described it?  Heh\u2026 well, I guess it is an old Bible after all.\"\r\n\"What can you tell me about it?  Was it authentic?  How much was it worth?\"\r\nHe gives me a long look which might be mistaken for disgust.  \"How much was it worth?  Who are you? You\u2019re not the client.  It\u2019s not your book.  You don\u2019t know anything about it.\"\r\n\"What about some jewelry of hers, some of ruby earrings, a necklace, and a bracelet? They\u2019re missing from her hotel room -- any chance you walked off with them accidentally?\"\r\n\"You can fuck right off out of my store.\"\r\n\"Whoa,\" I say.  \"Take it easy there, we\u2019re working for the same lady.\"\r\n\"I\u2019m not working for anybody -- she hasn\u2019t paid me yet.  She\u2019ll burn before I see a cent.\"\r\n\"What does that mean?\"\r\n\"Fuck off, you don\u2019t know.\"\r\n\"Mr. Wyckoff, where were you this morning around 8am?\"\r\n\"Fucking your wife, you vermin.\"\r\n\"I\u2019m not married.\"\r\nAt this point he calms himself down, then licks his finger and draws a large round circle in the air in front of my face.  \"Now you can *really* fuck off.\"\r\nI can see this is going nowhere, so I thank Wyckoff for his hospitality and then leave.\r\n---\r\nPlaying a hunch, I cross 3rd Avenue and enter a shop with a window facing Wyckoff\u2019s Rare Books.  Wyckoff himself comes limping out of his bookstore and flips the sign on the door from Open to Closed, then heads south on 3rd Avenue.\r\nHe\u2019s walking pretty fast for a guy with a limp, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to lose him, so I take my time and let him get half a block away before lighting up a cigarette and starting to follow him.\r\nHe continues south where 3rd Avenue turns into the Bowery, then turns left on Houston, and then right on Chrystie.  For a minute I panic when I think he\u2019s going to head into the train station on Delancey, and I close my distance.  But he keeps going until he hits the entry to the garden park, then hangs a left and goes down Grand Street.\r\nThen, something stupid happens.  He gets almost to the corner of Allen Street, and as I\u2019m reaching into my pocket to get another cigarette, the old guy suddenly turns around in a full circle and spots me looking right at him.\r\nI\u2019m caught off guard, and I hesitate before making a poor pretense at window shopping.  But I can see from the corner of my eye that he\u2019s looking right at me.\r\nEventually he heads into a real estate office on Allen Street.  Five minutes later he\u2019s headed back uptown the same way he came.\r\nI convince myself that maybe he didn\u2019t recognize me after all, and waste another 30 minutes following him back up to the bookstore, where he turns the sign from Closed to Open and doesn\u2019t emerge again.\r\n",

There\u2019s also  a younger guy sitting down next to him staring at the floor.  Late 20s maybe, short brown hair cut in a similar style.  Maybe these guys are cutting each other\u2019s hair.  There must be a back door too, since I hear it closing behind someone leaving.\r\nI take my time working my way to the back, looking through the worthless junk and occasional military souvenir.  The old man is standing over a cabinet of jewelry.  I take a quick scan -- nothing made of rubies, but a few odd items like a silver necklace with what looks like a razor blade in the center, and a gold bracelet with a pentagram charm.\r\n\"I\u2019m looking for a ruby bracelet that someone may have brought in recently.\"\r\n\"I don\u2019t know nothing about it.\" says the old man.\r\n\"I\u2019d like to see your records,\" I say.\r\n\"Get lost, you -- I don\u2019t got to show you nothin.

I told her that the hotel restaurant might be able to make her one at 8am, but she seemed in a hurry so I suggested a deli on 7th Avenue,\"  I\u2019m not sure where she went, but she was back by 8am or 8:30am.\"\r\n\"And she was alone when she left? And when she came back as well?\"\r\n\"I believe so.  I don\u2019t remember seeing anyone with her.\"\r\n\"And no one came by asking for her while she was out?\"\r\n\"I don\u2019t believe so.\"\r\n\"Well you were the only one on duty, right? You would know if someone came by looking for her, yeah?\"\r\n\"Yes, sir - Until 9am I was the only one on duty and couldn\u2019t leave my station unattended; so if anyone came by before then, I would have known about it.\"\r\n\"Very good.  Can you tell me if Mrs. Browning is in her room now?\" I ask.\r\n\"I believe she is, sir.\"\r\n\"And has she had any visitors today?\"\r\n\"She has not.\"\r\n\"And no one has called for her?\"\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\nI thank him for his help, and am just turning to leave when a thought seems to occur to him.\r\n\"Umm\u2026  Actually, you know, now that I think about it\u2026  There was something a little unusual that happened just before 8.  A man in overalls came in and walked right past me to the elevators.  I normally would have stopped him, because he didn\u2019t look like a guest, and it seemed a little early for maintenance work, but he seemed to know where he was going so I didn\u2019t think much of it.\"\r\n\"Could he have been going to Mrs. Browning\u2019s room?\"\r\n\"Well, I don\u2019t think so.  He\u2019d be going the long way around if he was.\"\r\n\"Can you remember what this fellow looked like?\"\r\n\"Let\u2019s see\u2026  Blue overalls and work boots.  Brown hair, slicked back. Maybe in his 20s?  He may have had glasses\u2026  I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t remember.\"\r\nI pass him my card.  \"If you think of anything else, give me a ring.\"\r\n",

              "reportText": "The Carnegie precinct looks like a cushy detail for cops wanting to enjoy the second half of their careers.  Back when I was a cop, I wouldn\u2019t be caught dead working in such a sleepy neighborhood.  The decor looks like they aren\u2019t hurting for money either.\r\nI look around on the off-chance that I recognize someone, but no such luck, so I tell the officer on duty that I\u2019m a PI and may have some information about yesterday\u2019s murder at the Engineer\u2019s Gate in Central Park.  He directs me to the detectives\u2019 room up the wide polished marble staircase.\r\nThe detective in charge of the case has his own office, and not a small one.  He\u2019s eating a sandwich with a knife and a fork.  He sees me staring at his plate.\r\n\"My dentures are acting up,\" he says, pointing to his mouth with his fork, as if that explained it. \"What do you know about my murder?\"\r\n\"Was he a tall guy, tan suit, pencil-thin moustache?\"\r\n\"Yeah, what do you know about him?\"\r\nI decide that he doesn\u2019t need to know about Mrs. Browning and her book, and just tell him that I think it\u2019s likely he was killed by the same guy who cut the throat of the subway attendant at 51st Street.\r\n\"Did you identify the body?\" I ask.\r\nDentures pauses with the fork half-way in his mouth and peers up at me.  This guy\u2019s going to make me work for it.\r\n\"Was it by any chance a Walenty Gorski?\" I ask.\r\n\"No. Who\u2019s Gorski?\"\r\nI lean closer and give him my best \"we\u2019re on the same team\" look.  \"Tell you what: I\u2019ll share what I know if you give me the name of the victim.  It\u2019s going to be in the paper by tomorrow anyway.\"\r\nAfter a bit more back-and-forth he tells me that the dead guy was Constantine Afanasyev, resident of East Village.  He was found face-down outside of Central Park, at the Engineer\u2019s Gate entrance.  He had a large buck knife in his lower back, and was stabbed several times. Was probably dead within minutes.\r\nThey think he was killed late last night.  He didn\u2019t have Gorski\u2019s mail on him, just a wallet with a few bucks, some change, a driver\u2019s license, and some weird notes that they couldn\u2019t make sense of -- written in a foreign language, they think.  I ask to see the notes and he tells me I\u2019d have a better chance getting a date with Lana Turner.\r\n\"We\u2019re still waiting on an autopsy from the Chief Medical examiner, but it looks like this guy was dead within minutes of the attack -- didn\u2019t even get a chance to run.\"\r\n\"Any idea what he was doing uptown?\" I finally ask.\r\n\"You tell me,\" he says, forking in another square.\r\n%boxstartred%\n%Symbol.Mark%You have now gained the marker [**C2 = CarnegiePrecinct**]; please circle this letter in your case log (if it's not already circled).\n%boxend%\n---\n\n**DEBUG:** This lead \"suggests\" #[4-5063: Central Park - Engineer\u2019s Gate](#4-5063+p)\n",

It has a spooky feel, with antique light-bulbs and a maze of 10ft-high floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, all cramped into a footprint that can\u2019t be more than 20ft by 20ft.\r\nI find the proprietor, an old white-haired gentleman, limping down one of the rows with a large blackened tome in his hand and searching for a place to put it.  It looks heavy, but he doesn\u2019t seem to be having any trouble carrying it.  He finally shelves it next to another large book -- this one red, with what looks like a child\u2019s drawing of a skull on the cover.\r\n\"You must be Mr. Wyckoff,\" I say.\r\nHe looks me up and down as if sizing me up.  \"And who are you?\" he says.\r\n\"I\u2019m Jack Deverell, Mr. Wyckoff.  I\u2019ve been hired by a Mrs. Browning to help locate a lost book.  I\u2019m told you met with her on Sunday to appraise it.  An old Bible.\"\r\n\"*An old Bible!* **Ha!** Is that how she described it?  Heh\u2026 well, I guess it is an old Bible after all.\"\r\n\"What can you tell me about it?  Was it authentic?  How much was it worth?\"\r\nHe gives me a long look which might be mistaken for disgust.  \"How much was it worth?  Who are you? You\u2019re not the client.  It\u2019s not your book.  You don\u2019t know anything about it.\"\r\n\"What about some jewelry of hers, some of ruby earrings, a necklace, and a bracelet? They\u2019re missing from her hotel room -- any chance you walked off with them accidentally?\"\r\n\"You can fuck right off out of my store.\"\r\n\"Whoa,\" I say.  \"Take it easy there, we\u2019re working for the same lady.\"\r\n\"I\u2019m not working for anybody -- she hasn\u2019t paid me yet.  She\u2019ll burn before I see a cent.\"\r\n\"What does that mean?\"\r\n\"Fuck off, you don\u2019t know.\"\r\n\"Mr. Wyckoff, where were you this morning around 8am?\"\r\n\"Fucking your wife, you vermin.\"\r\n\"I\u2019m not married.\"\r\nAt this point he calms himself down, then licks his finger and draws a large round circle in the air in front of my face.  \"Now you can *really* fuck off.\"\r\nI can see this is going nowhere, so I thank Wyckoff for his hospitality and then leave.\r\n---\r\nPlaying a hunch, I cross 3rd Avenue and enter a shop with a window facing Wyckoff\u2019s Rare Books.  Wyckoff himself comes limping out of his bookstore and flips the sign on the door from Open to Closed, then heads south on 3rd Avenue.\r\nHe\u2019s walking pretty fast for a guy with a limp, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to lose him, so I take my time and let him get half a block away before lighting up a cigarette and starting to follow him.\r\nHe continues south where 3rd Avenue turns into the Bowery, then turns left on Houston, and then right on Chrystie.  For a minute I panic when I think he\u2019s going to head into the train station on Delancey, and I close my distance.  But he keeps going until he hits the entry to the garden park, then hangs a left and goes down Grand Street.\r\nThen, something stupid happens.  He gets almost to the corner of Allen Street, and as I\u2019m reaching into my pocket to get another cigarette, the old guy suddenly turns around in a full circle and spots me looking right at him.\r\nI\u2019m caught off guard, and I hesitate before making a poor pretense at window shopping.  But I can see from the corner of my eye that he\u2019s looking right at me.\r\nEventually he heads into a real estate office on Allen Street.  Five minutes later he\u2019s headed back uptown the same way he came.\r\nI convince myself that maybe he didn\u2019t recognize me after all, and waste another 30 minutes following him back up to the bookstore, where he turns the sign from Closed to Open and doesn\u2019t emerge again.\r\n",

Then there\u2019s the issue of the stolen jewelry.  It\u2019s hard to know if it\u2019s central to your case or not, but you should definitely chase down the details and try to put a bow on that -- at least figure out who\u2019s involved even if hard proof and recovering the jewels is outside the scope of your work.  Maybe track down those packages as well -- might give you a few more clues about who\u2019s behind this whole thing.\"\r\n\"What about these stabbings -- I\u2019m sure they\u2019re related to my case.\"\r\n\"Well then, track down the victims and see what you can learn about them.

A short, balding gentleman, and an older, taller gentleman.\"\r\n\"One last question.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that Mrs. Browning had an expensive item stolen from her hotel room while she was out getting breakfast.  Have you talked to the maids on duty?

As a PI, though, the best I can do is try to sweet talk the gal at the front desk -- Mary, who knows me from my days on the force.\r\n\"How are you doing, Mary? Long time no see.\"\r\n\"Jack, it\u2019s good to see you landed on your feet.  That wasn\u2019t right what happened to you.\"\r\n\"Water under the bridge,\" I say.  Not quite true, but maybe if I say it enough I\u2019ll believe it myself one day.  \"Mary, can you give me something on that murder in Central Park? I\u2019m working a case that the victim was involved in.\"\r\nShe looks around a little before drawing me closer.  \"I don\u2019t know much, they\u2019re still working it.  But, I know the guy was stabbed a bunch of times in the back.  Lots of blood, they think he died quickly.  But also, it seems like the killer did something weird.  Carved some kind of symbol in his back after he killed him.  That\u2019s all I know.\"\r\n\"Thanks, Mary, I owe you one.\"\r\n%boxstartred%\n%Symbol.Mark%You have now gained the marker [**M2 = MedicalExaminer**]; please circle this letter in your case log (if it's not already circled).\n%boxend%",

A man\u2019s been injured.\"  Then I take off my tie and give it to the man, motioning that he should put it around his neck -- but he\u2019s in shock, he\u2019s not hearing anything I\u2019m saying.  I hear footsteps coming down the stairs, and decide I\u2019m not much more good to him now.\r\nI jump the turnstile and rush through into the doors of the uptown IRT just as they\u2019re closing.  The train pulls out of the station, and I can hear some faint screaming from the platform.\r\nI sit down and try to calm my breathing and regain my wits.  What just happened?  I don\u2019t think I was spotted by my guy, but even if I was, why would he have attacked this attendant?  Was this just a coincidence? \r\nI look around for my guy in the tan suit.  Everyone looks suspicious and malevolent, and I\u2019m having trouble concentrating.  Eventually I do spot him, calm as can be, reading a paperback at the end of the car without a care in the world.\r\nBy the time we get to Lenox HIll, my breathing has slowed down.  At 86th Street my guy gets up and heads to the door.  I look for signs he knows he\u2019s being followed, but he seems oblivious.  If this is the guy who cut the throat of the subway attendant, his veins are filled with ice water.\r\nI head to the same door, determined not to lose him again -- but there\u2019s a small crowd of people between us, and as the doors open he\u2019s first to exit, while the lady in front of me struggles with her shopping cart.\r\nBy the time I get out of the door I\u2019ve lost sight of him, but I pick up my pace towards the exit as the train pulls away, and it won\u2019t be hard to spot him once we get up to street level.\r\nThere\u2019s nowhere for him to go but up.\r\nThen suddenly I\u2019m slammed hard from the left. Feels like I walked in front of a train, and for a minute that\u2019s where my brain goes.  But then I\u2019m over the edge of the platform and onto the train tracks, my ankle twisting as I fall.  I hit my head hard on one of the rails.  \r\nMy vision swims, and for a second that strange, exotic smell fills my nostrils. I feel myself black out for a moment.

Back when I was a cop, I wouldn\u2019t be caught dead working in such a sleepy neighborhood.  The decor looks like they aren\u2019t hurting for money either.\r\nI look around on the off-chance that I recognize someone, but no such luck, so I tell the officer on duty that I\u2019m a PI and may have some information about yesterday\u2019s murder at the Engineer\u2019s Gate in Central Park.  He directs me to the detectives\u2019 room up the wide polished marble staircase.\r\nThe detective in charge of the case has his own office, and not a small one.  He\u2019s eating a sandwich with a knife and a fork.  He sees me staring at his plate.\r\n\"My dentures are acting up,\" he says, pointing to his mouth with his fork, as if that explained it. \"What do you know about my murder?\"\r\n\"Was he a tall guy, tan suit, pencil-thin moustache?\"\r\n\"Yeah, what do you know about him?\"\r\nI decide that he doesn\u2019t need to know about Mrs. Browning and her book, and just tell him that I think it\u2019s likely he was killed by the same guy who cut the throat of the subway attendant at 51st Street.\r\n\"Did you identify the body?\" I ask.\r\nDentures pauses with the fork half-way in his mouth and peers up at me.  This guy\u2019s going to make me work for it.\r\n\"Was it by any chance a Walenty Gorski?\" I ask.\r\n\"No. Who\u2019s Gorski?\"\r\nI lean closer and give him my best \"we\u2019re on the same team\" look.  \"Tell you what: I\u2019ll share what I know if you give me the name of the victim.  It\u2019s going to be in the paper by tomorrow anyway.\"\r\nAfter a bit more back-and-forth he tells me that the dead guy was Constantine Afanasyev, resident of East Village.  He was found face-down outside of Central Park, at the Engineer\u2019s Gate entrance.  He had a large buck knife in his lower back, and was stabbed several times. Was probably dead within minutes.\r\nThey think he was killed late last night.  He didn\u2019t have Gorski\u2019s mail on him, just a wallet with a few bucks, some change, a driver\u2019s license, and some weird notes that they couldn\u2019t make sense of -- written in a foreign language, they think.  I ask to see the notes and he tells me I\u2019d have a better chance getting a date with Lana Turner.\r\n\"We\u2019re still waiting on an autopsy from the Chief Medical examiner, but it looks like this guy was dead within minutes of the attack -- didn\u2019t even get a chance to run.\"\r\n\"Any idea what he was doing uptown?\" I finally ask.\r\n\"You tell me,\" he says, forking in another square.\r\n",

Maybe track down those packages as well -- might give you a few more clues about who\u2019s behind this whole thing.\"\r\n\"What about these stabbings -- I\u2019m sure they\u2019re related to my case.\"\r\n\"Well then, track down the victims and see what you can learn about them.  Where did they live?  Where did they work?  Etc.  I always tell you to focus on the people, the rest will fall into place.  And have you got a theory about how the book was taken?  Seems to me you need to develop a theory for who could have taken it and how, even if their motives are unclear.  Remember, Jack, you cut your teeth in financial crimes; sometimes a motive is as simple as pay for hire, so It wouldn\u2019t hurt to try to follow up that angle and knock on a few doors.\"\r\n",

Those can sometimes strike gold, especially when you\u2019re dealing with rich people who may want to avoid public transportation.\r\nAnd I know you like to have hard and fast proof for everything, Jack, but sometimes in a case like this the best you can do is circumstantial evidence that puts the right person at the right place at the right time -- so to speak.\r\nNow about your murders: if you haven\u2019t identified the culprit by name, well, it may mean there\u2019s no way to do so\u2026  On the other hand, it may be that you can, if you can locate people who interacted with him, and get enough pieces of identifying information out of them.\r\nIf you can get a good description from someone who saw him, it\u2019s possible you can reach out to a governmental office that could put a name to a face.

They\u2019re likely to keep it under wraps until it\u2019s safe to dispose of.

              "reportText": "Probably it\u2019s the connection to our case, but I find myself genuinely curious about the exhibit of controversial religious books.  Jewel and I hop the train to 79th Street on the Upper West Side.\r\nThe midnight gala event at the museum is a pretty ritzy affair.  I\u2019m not sure how Jewel managed to get us tickets at the last minute, but she\u2019s resourceful like that.  As we\u2019re walking up the steps we see mayor Fiorello La Guardia, already inside shaking hands with someone, his pudgy face and rotund body exuding unmistakeable charm.\r\n![image](images/MuseumNaturalHistory2.jpg|height=6in)\r\nThe Museum of Natural History is one of my favorite places.  It\u2019s an awe-inspiring place. Dozens of dimly-lit rooms, with giant life-sized dioramas of cavemen and dinosaurs, pottery and tablets from the beginning of civilization, and sparkling gemstones the size of your head.\r\nJewel seems just as interested as I am, and we leisurely walk to the religious book exhibit, separated by only a few feet of space but a million years of daydreaming.\r\nThe controversial book exhibit itself is mildly interesting.  I\u2019m half-expecting to see a copy of Mrs. Browning\u2019s book on display, but no dice.  There\u2019s a big section discussing religious books from different cultures, and how each one was treated as blasphemous and sacrilegious by others, despite their common themes.  And there\u2019s a section of shockingly vibrant paintings of Hindu gods that defy description.  I make a note to myself to dig out my oil paints when I get home.\r\nThere is a section on controversial Christian Bibles, but they seem to be mostly about misprinted editions. The \"Wicked\" Bible, otherwise known as the \"Sinner\u2019s Bible\", was published in 1631 in London, where they accidentally left out the word \"not\" from the sentence \"Thou shalt not commit adultery.\"  Ouch.  Most copies were destroyed, making it highly valuable.  But there\u2019s no hint of any controversy related to Mrs. Browning\u2019s book.\r\n\"Pretty fascinating stuff, huh, Jewel?\"\r\nJewel doesn\u2019t hear me; she\u2019s lost in thought.  We wander around a bit more in silence, then part ways and head to our respective homes.\r\n%boxstartred%\n%Symbol.Checkbox%Mark **3** culture checkboxes in your case log.\n%boxend%\n\r\n%boxstartred%\n%Symbol.Mark%You have now gained the marker [**B = jewel**]; please circle this letter in your case log (if it's not already circled).\n%boxend%\n%boxstartred% Now return to [Day 2 Late Night Leads](#Day_2_Late_Night_Leads+p). %boxend%\n\n---\n\n**DEBUG:** [Day 2 Morning](#Day_2_Morning+p) \"suggests\" this lead.\n",

The charging documents describe how Mr. Bahandari attacked Mr. Afanasyev outside of Central Park after following him from his place of work, the Convent of the Sacred Heart.  Early reporting suggests that Mr. Bahandari was operating at the behest of Mrs. Browning, whose background and occupation remain unconfirmed.\r\n%Separator.Final%\r\n## NEW YORK TIMES - Wednesday, March 12th, 1948*\r\nNew developments emerged today in the case of last week\u2019s Central Park stabbing of Constantine Afanasyev.   Rumors continue to circulate about the two suspects who have been charged with the murder, Mr. Choka Bahandari and Mrs. Clarice Browning.  Reliable sources have told the Times that the two are well known in Salem, and are rumored to be members of an underground religious organization long banned in the state of Massachusetts.

District Attorney Frank Hogan laid out the facts of the case:  In early March of this year, Mrs. Browning arrived in the Cumberland Hotel in Manhattan, carrying with her an occult book she intended to have appraised and then sold.  To a shocked courtroom, he described the book as a rare and sacrilegious text: a corrupted variant of the Octavo King James Bible, produced in 1600 by an underground group of dissident monks, with a dozen or more additional hand-illustrated pages of pornographic, satanic, and occult imagery. The one-of-a-kind Bible was purchased by Mrs. Browning\u2019s ancestor, and had only ever been rumored among occultists to exist.\r\nMr. Hogan described the chain of events as follows: Mrs. Browning used her contacts in the occult underworld to locate two potential dealers for an appraisal of the Bible.  One of these, a Mr. Wyckoff, allegedly robbed Mrs. Browning of valuable jewelry while briefly left alone with the book in her hotel room.  The jewelry was recovered from the pawnshop of a Mr. Cremonesi, who has since pleaded guilty to receipt of stolen goods.\r\n > *As I read this I think back over my interactions with Wyckoff and Cremonesi, how the two of them used some of the same odd vernacular, and how Cremonesi had slipped up when denying he had seen the stolen jewelry.  Not to mention how Wyckoff had been steps away from the pawn shop before he spotted me and turned back.*\r\nThe other dealer, going by the name Walenty Gorski, was in truth an agent for an underground Catholic organization whose stated purpose is to remove sacrilegious texts from distribution.  It appears this organization, operating locally out of the Convent of the Sacred Heart, had become aware of the book\u2019s existence and sought to steal it.\r\nThe organization used the Phoenix Safe Company, owned by a sympathetically aligned religious family, to burgle the hotel room of Mrs. Browning and steal the book.  Father and son, both trained locksmiths, allegedly worked together -- one monitoring the whereabouts of Mrs. Browning while she left her hotel room for breakfast, and the other picking the lock of her hotel room door in order to obtain the book.  Witnesses at the Cumberland Hotel and the Carnegie Deli were able to positively identify both men.  It is unclear whether the ultimate aim was to acquire the book in order to dispose of it, or simply to remove it from circulation.\r\nWhen Mrs. Browning discovered that the book had been stolen, she hired a private investigator to track it down, but directed her accomplice Mr. Bahandari (who had secretly checked into a separate room of the hotel) to conduct a parallel investigation, and to recover the book by any means necessary.  \r\n%Separator.Final%\r\n## NEW YORK TIMES - Tuesday, May 4th, 1948*\r\nThe prosecution today continued their case against Clarice Browning and Choka Bahandari,  describing how Mr. Bahandari had managed to locate an employee of the  Sacred Heart Convent, Constantine Afanasyev.  Mr. Afanasyev had been hired to pick up mail from the Gorski residence, which was used by the organization as a kind of front from which they could safely conduct their clandestine operations.  Afanasyev was apparently followed to the Convent of the Sacred Heart, and murdered nearby.\r\nIn a shocking disclosure, the district attorney described a second, previously unreported murder of another Sacred Heart employee, believed to be the book appraiser known to Mrs. Browning as Walenty Gorski.  This man appears to have been tortured in an attempt to force him to reveal the location of the stolen book.\r\nThe prosecution has not yet identified the dead man, but they have confirmed that the real Gorski died several years ago.

District Attorney Frank Hogan laid out the facts of the case:  In early March of this year, Mrs. Browning arrived in the Cumberland Hotel in Manhattan, carrying with her an occult book she intended to have appraised and then sold.  To a shocked courtroom, he described the book as a rare and sacrilegious text: a corrupted variant of the Octavo King James Bible, produced in 1600 by an underground group of dissident monks, with a dozen or more additional hand-illustrated pages of pornographic, satanic, and occult imagery. The one-of-a-kind Bible was purchased by Mrs. Browning\u2019s ancestor, and had only ever been rumored among occultists to exist.\r\nMr. Hogan described the chain of events as follows: Mrs. Browning used her contacts in the occult underworld to locate two potential dealers for an appraisal of the Bible.  One of these, a Mr. Wyckoff, allegedly robbed Mrs. Browning of valuable jewelry while briefly left alone with the book in her hotel room.  The jewelry was recovered from the pawnshop of a Mr. Cremonesi, who has since pleaded guilty to receipt of stolen goods.\r\n > *As I read this I think back over my interactions with Wyckoff and Cremonesi, how the two of them used some of the same odd vernacular, and how Cremonesi had slipped up when denying he had seen the stolen jewelry.  Not to mention how Wyckoff had been steps away from the pawn shop before he spotted me and turned back.*\r\nThe other dealer, going by the name Walenty Gorski, was in truth an agent for an underground Catholic organization whose stated purpose is to remove sacrilegious texts from distribution.  It appears this organization, operating locally out of the Convent of the Sacred Heart, had become aware of the book\u2019s existence and sought to steal it.\r\nThe organization used the Phoenix Safe Company, owned by a sympathetically aligned religious family, to burgle the hotel room of Mrs. Browning and steal the book.  Father and son, both trained locksmiths, allegedly worked together -- one monitoring the whereabouts of Mrs. Browning while she left her hotel room for breakfast, and the other picking the lock of her hotel room door in order to obtain the book.  Witnesses at the Cumberland Hotel and the Carnegie Deli were able to positively identify both men.  It is unclear whether the ultimate aim was to acquire the book in order to dispose of it, or simply to remove it from circulation.\r\nWhen Mrs. Browning discovered that the book had been stolen, she hired a private investigator to track it down, but directed her accomplice Mr. Bahandari (who had secretly checked into a separate room of the hotel) to conduct a parallel investigation, and to recover the book by any means necessary.  \r\n%Separator.Final%\r\n## NEW YORK TIMES - Tuesday, May 4th, 1948*\r\nThe prosecution today continued their case against Clarice Browning and Choka Bahandari,  describing how Mr. Bahandari had managed to locate an employee of the  Sacred Heart Convent, Constantine Afanasyev.  Mr. Afanasyev had been hired to pick up mail from the Gorski residence, which was used by the organization as a kind of front from which they could safely conduct their clandestine operations.  Afanasyev was apparently followed to the Convent of the Sacred Heart, and murdered nearby.\r\nIn a shocking disclosure, the district attorney described a second, previously unreported murder of another Sacred Heart employee, believed to be the book appraiser known to Mrs. Browning as Walenty Gorski.  This man appears to have been tortured in an attempt to force him to reveal the location of the stolen book.\r\nThe prosecution has not yet identified the dead man, but they have confirmed that the real Gorski died several years ago.  It now appears that the Sacred Heart offices, along with the apartment where Gorski\u2019s mail was delivered, were being used as a front for their clandestine operation; fake identities were also used to protect their members.  The motive behind these actions remains unclear, as does the method by which they made contact with Mrs. Browning.

                "text": "I hope you have enjoyed this case.  I tried to make this one a little tricky with a variety of obstacles that you would have to figure out to follow up on leads.\r\nOne of the elements of the case that was most tricky was the way you were supposed to figure out that Wyckoff stole the jewelry.  Here is what I tried to do:\r\nWhen you tail Wyckoff from his shop, he spots you at the end.  He made it to just right across the street from a pawn shop, which is meant to connect him to it.  The especially tricky part, however, is that he is right at the boundary of neighborhoods, and the pawn shop is in the next neighborhood over (Lower East Side).\r\nYou may in fact discover that pawn shop, as one player did, while investigating the dead body of Constantine, which may lead you to wrongly think he was the one who stole the jewelry.\r\nThere are, however, two more clues to connect Wyckoff to the pawn shop.  First, Wyckoff and Cremonesi, the pawn shop owner, have a similar disposition, and both use the words \"vermin\" -- I suspect they are good friends.  More damning, however, is that when we question the pawn shop owner, we mention \"a stolen bracelet\", when in fact it was several items that were stolen. He says \"I haven\u2019t seen **them**.\"  A little slip-up on his part that tells you he\u2019s our man.\r\nAs a side note, early playtesters suffered trying to find the pawnshop because I accidentally put two more pawn shops on the same block as where Wyckoff turned around, and in the neighborhood where he was walking. Ouch.\r\nAnother subtle element is in the third note you get.  If you study it you will note that the word \"safe\" is used many times -- that\u2019s meant to clue you in that he\u2019s stashed it at the Phoenix Safe Company in the floor safe that is mentioned.  The old man and the kid with long brown hair that work there are the same people who were watching and breaking into Mrs. Browning\u2019s hotel room on day 2.  The old man follows her to Carnegie Deli while the kid gets into her hotel room.  You\u2019ll note that the PSC log on the Sacred Heart Convent is from their locksmith shop.\r\nI had some spirited debates with playtesters about whether the clues to Phoenix Safe company were strong enough or too subtle.  In response I made some later changes to make it both a little bit easier to connect the Deli witness to the Phoenix guy, but also added a question that asked the players how they would prove it if they had to -- my hope is that that question will spur some debate (the answer is that you could try to get the deli and hotel people to id the phoenix father and son).\r\nOne more subtle element is tracking down the name of the killer, who works for Mrs. Browning.  To do so you\u2019ll have to visit the taxi company serving the neighborhood where the murder took place.  The taxi company gives you the name of the driver and tells you to come back tomorrow when she gets in\u2026 but your case doesn\u2019t last 4 days, so you\u2019ll have to visit her yourself.  She\u2019ll tell you his nationality and his first name.  With that you could go to the Indian Consulate and find out his full name.  And with that you can revisit the hotel to get his room number.  Note that this was meant to be a non-essential part of the mystery that only advanced players would be able to find.  I have to admit that a trip to the Indian Consulate is not the first thing that I would have thought to do.  So many consulates, so little time.\r\nThe last bit of bonus mystery for advanced players relates to the real identity of the man known as Gorski and the larger organization behind him.  If you visit the Property & tax records office (6-5810): NYC Department of Finance (see Research Guide), you will learn the name of Reverend Carlo Lori, whom you can visit to confirm that he is the man behind the operation (and the man pretending to be Gorski).\r\nI should note that there is a fair amount of disagreement on the part of early playtesters regarding the difficulty of the case and whether there is sufficient evidence for players to answer the questions about who took the book.  To me it feels like it\u2019s a hard case but that there are enough clues to make an educated guess.  What do you think?\r\nI hope you enjoyed the moral and other choices you faced.  Which choices did you make, and why?  There are no right or wrong answers.  You might be wondering about the instructions to record things in your \"Campaign Log\".  This case occurs somewhere in the middle of a long campaign planned for High & Low, with legacy elements where your decisions in one case may carry over to another.  Whether that campaign gets finished remains to be seen.\r\nOne of the mechanical aspects of the case that underwent lots of debate was the use of the markers to \"gate\" your progress between days, to make sure you had seen certain things each day.  The basic idea of doing this has always been a key part to High & Low, to help make the multi-day structure work.  Essentially this process ensures that players have seen critical leads so they have a reasonable chance of solving the case at the end, and that they don\u2019t miss a critical lead that will make the experience unpleasant.  This was originally implemented in this case by having the player answer end-of-day questions that asked about certain things and sent them back into the field if they hadn\u2019t found them.  Afterwards I had the idea of using the conditional markers (e.g. \"mark letter A\"), which are already used to check certain conditions, as checks between days.  This works mechanically, and we added a kind of time deadline to add some tension and reward efficient players -- though I hope it will not serve to discourage players from investigating everything.  An in-game hint system was added to help players that feel stuck and don\u2019t know what to do.\r\nI\u2019d love to hear what you thought of the case and any bugs you found. You can contact me at jessereichler@gmail.com or stop by the Co-op For Two YouTube Channel or Discord server (link on YouTube \"About\" page).\r\nIf you\u2019re interested in making your own case for the High & Low system, stop by boardgamegeek.com and reach out to me -- the materials are all available and I\u2019d love to see more cases made.\r\nSpecial thanks to Debbie Levy for editing, and to early beta testers Dispaminite, Rocky Helton (who made his own case!), Jonathan Warner, Nicola Salmoria, and all the others in the High & Low Discord roundtable for talking through ideas.\r\n-Jesse Reichler, February 20, 2024\r\n\r\n",
